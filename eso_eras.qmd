# Early Recovery after Esophagectomy

ERAS society guidelines  [@low299]. 

Systmatic review of enhanced recovery for esophagectomy [@findlay413]

Meta-analysis [@pisarskae0174382], included 2042 patients (1058 in an ERAS group vs 984 in a traditional group), revealed a significantly shorter hospital stay and fewer non-surgical and pulmonary complications in the ERAS group, but no effect on overall morbidity, mortality or readmission rates.

## Nutritional Assessment

Patients with esophageal cancer frequently suffer from undernutrition due to GI tract obstruction and the pro-inflammatory effects of cancer and the effects of neoadjuvant therapy. Preoperative evaluation should include history of  weight loss, dysphagia, odynophagia.  Nutrition support from has been suggested to improve outcomes after esophagectomy in retrospective studies.[@ligthart-melis587] ESPN (ASPEN?) guidelines suggest strategies for nutritional support in cancer patients.[@arends11]

1 - No weight loss

2 - 5% weight loss and moderate

3 - 10% weight loss and severe dysphagia

Dysphagia score [@knyrim1302] - scale used for esophageal stent paper


**Questions:**

  1 - Standardized Nutritional assessment
  
  2 - Standardized Dysphagia score
  
  3 - Categorize weight loss with respect to BMI (Martin, JCO)
  
  4 - Who needs a preoperative feeding tube?


## Preoperative enteral nutrition

Feeding jejunostomy is the traditional approach to enteral tube placement in patients who may undergo surgery in the future.  Gastrostomy placement, particularly via the endoscopic approach (PEG) runs the risk of damage to the right gastroepiploic vascular arcade, which might devascularize a future gastric conduit, although small series suggest that this risk is low [@margolis1694]

Anecdotal data suggests that esophagectommy with gastric conduit can safely be performed after gastrostomy, particularly if placement is done via laparoscopy and if the tube can be removed prior to esophagectomy to allow the tract to heal. PEG placement (via endoscopy) runs a small but finite risk of seeding of the gastrostomy tract with tumor.[@ellrichmann526]

## Nutritional Repletion

**Question:**

1 - What criteria should be used to guide nutritional repletion in the context of weight loss?

2 - Which patient who don't receive a feeding tube prior to chemoRT need one postop?

## Pre-habilitation

General references in abdominal and cancer surgery - at least 4 weeks of rehabilitation are superior to postoperative rehabilitation [@gillis391]

Prehabilitation review by expert panel [@carli49]


Implementation of a respiratory care intervention consisting of incentive spirometry, coughing, oral care, patient education, ambulation, and head of bed elevation for general and vascular surgery patients was associated with a significant decrease in rates of pneumonia and re-intubation[@cassidy740]

on the return of functional activity after a major surgical procedure. Hence, efforts to optimize functional capacity prior to surgery have shown improved outcomes for some abdominal and oncologic surgeries [20]. A multimodal approach termed as ‘prehabilitation’ comprising nutritional supplementation, psychological counselling, medical optimization, and a structured exercise program involving both aerobic and strengthening activity has been proposed to improve outcomes [21]. Respiratory optimization with deep breathing exercises, spirometry, and inspiratory muscle training decreases pulmonary complications [22]. Studies have shown that prehabilitation reduces anxiety, depression and fatigue, and improves the quality of life [23]. Preliminary results from a recently concluded study [24] on prehabilitation for esophageal surgery demonstrated improvement in functional capacity; however, the impact on postoperative outcomes needs to be evaluated by further ongoing studies [25]. Extrapolation from studies on other abdominal surgeries [20] suggests that at least 4 weeks of preoperative prehabilitation is better than postoperative rehabilitation to influence outcomes. As most patients with operable esophageal cancer would receive neoadjuvant treatment, it would be opportunistic to use this preoperative window to initiate prehabilitation.

## Jejunostomy

Retrospective analysis suggests a benefit from jejunostomy placed at the time of esophagectomy.[@watson421]*

**Question:**

1 - What is a reasonable approach to starting tube feeds in a postoperative patient?

2 - Tube feed formulae for the morbidly obese patient?

3 - What criteria (diarrhea/bloating) should be used to change in tube feed formula?

4 - Feeding plan after esophagectomy (ie transition from tube feeds to oral nutrition)
