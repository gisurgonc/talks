# Early Recovery after Esophagectomy

ERAS society guidelines  [@low299]. 

Systmatic review 2014  [@findlay413]

Meta-analysis [@pisarskae0174382], included 2042 patients (1058 in an ERAS group vs 984 in a traditional group), revealed a significantly shorter hospital stay and fewer non-surgical and pulmonary complications in the ERAS group, but no effect on overall morbidity, mortality or readmission rates. 

Meta-analysis of critical factors  [@markar1] 

## Nutritional Assessment

## Preoperative enteral nutrition

## Smoking Cessation

Randomized trial of smoking cessation [@lindstrom739]

## Preoperative counseling

## Preoperative pulmonary function testing

Society for Thoracic Surgery database dictates pulmonary function testing on all patients prior to esophagectomy

## VTE Prophylaxis

American College of Chest Physicians guidelines[@goulde227S]

*Should we administer preoperative heparin routinely?*

*Duration of prophylactic anticoagulation after hospital discharge?*

*Resumption of anticoagulation in the chronically-anticoagulated patient?*
