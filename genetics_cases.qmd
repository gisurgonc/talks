## Lynch Screening

Women with Lymch have 25-60% lifetime risk of endometrial cancer 45-12% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer Male: 1.2% risk of breast cancer (0.1% in general populations)

## MMR and MSI

Greater than 90% of LS tumors are MSI-high (MSI-H) and/or lack expression of at least one of the MMR proteins by IHC. Ten percent to 15% of sporadic colon cancers exhibit abnormal IHC and are MSI-H most often due to abnormal methylation of the MLH1 gene promoter, rather than due to LS. Mutant BRAF V600E is found in many sporadic MSI-H CRCs and is rarely found in LS-related CRCs. There are some tumors that will have MLH1 methylation but lack a BRAF PV.
