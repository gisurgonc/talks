## Superficial Tumors

Workup of nodular Barretts:

-   Endoscopic Ultrasound
-   Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
    -   Diagnostic (T staging)
    -   May be therapeutic for T1a tumors

## KIT and PDGFR Mutations

![](images/kit_pdgrfa.png){fig-align="center"}

## Prognoatic factors

- Mitotic rate
- Tumor size
- Tumor site
- Tumor rupture (during or before surgery)
- Some genotypes have a peculiar history
  - Wild type kit/PDGRF are less aggressive
  
## Small Tumors (minimal dysphagia)

-   EUS to distinguish T2 from T3 tumors
-   If uT2 N0 $\rightarrow$ CT chest/abdomen/pelvis $\rightarrow$ Esophagectomy
-   If uT3 or N1 $\rightarrow$ PET $\rightarrow$ neoadjuvant therapy

Patients with dysphagia almost always are T3 tumors (and don't need EUS)

## Symptomatic Tumors (Dysphagia)

Patients with dysphagia to solids or weight loss or tumor length \>3cm are unlikely to have T1-2 tumors and can be initially evaluated with [PET Scan]

-   Disease confined to the esophagus and regional nodes $\rightarrow$ [Locally-advanced]
-   Metastatic disease $\rightarrow$ [Metastatic]
-   N3 $\rightarrow$ induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgical evaluation.

## ACOSOG ZZ9001

GIST Tumors >3cm randomized:
- 1 year of imatinib 40mg
- Observation

Recurrence-free survival 98% vs 83%
No significant difference at 6 years

*Imatinib may simply delay recurrences*

## SSG SVII

High-risk GIST randomized:
- 1 year of imatinib 400mg
- 3 year of imatinib 400mg

5-year Recurrence-free survival 48% vs 66%
5-year Overall Survival 82% vs 92%

## Mutational Testing

Genetic mutations can predict respoinse to imatinib [^2]

[^2]: Meheran JCO 2017

## Locally-advanced

For patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer, improved survival with adjunctive therapy. There are two options:

-   ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery ([CROSS Trial])
-   Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemo ([EsoPEC Trial])



## Positive Margins

-   368 esophageal cancer patients randomized:
    -   Surgery alone
    -   Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery
-   75% adenocarcinoma
-   T3: 80%. T2: 17%
-   median age=60
-   longer survival with Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery

## Imatinib 1yr vs 3 yr

-   368 esophageal cancer patients randomized:
    -   Surgery alone
    -   Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery
-   75% adenocarcinoma
-   T3: 80%. T2: 17%
-   median age=60
-   longer survival with Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery

## Wild-Type GIST

- SDH-Deficient
    - SDHx mutation
    - SDH wild-type
  - Associated with Carney-Stratakis syndrome
- No SDH Deficiency
  - NF1-GIST
  - Sporadic Wild-Type GIST

## NF1-associated GIST

- Multicentric (33%)
- Median age 46
- Small bowel >> Duodenum >> Stomach

## CROSS - Pathologic Response

pCR seen in 23% of patients with adenocarcinoma

pCR seen in 40% of patients with squamous cell carcinoma

## CROSS - Sites of Failure

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
Sites of failure over time 

ChemoRT + Surgery *vs* Surgery

ChemoRT appears to reduce risk of local or local+distant failure, but not isolated distant failure

## Nivolumab

## Chekmate 577 Trial

EsoCA patients who received ChemoRT$\rightarrow$ Surgery with residual disease (not pCR)

Randomized to one year of immunotherapy (nivolumab) vs Observation

Adjuvant nivolumab group had better survival

## Neoadjuvant Chemo for EsoCA

-   MAGIC trial (gastric): ECF[^3]$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ECF *vs* Surgery\
-   OEO2 Trial: (esophageal) Chemo$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ Chemo *vs* Surgery\
-   FLOT (gastric): FLOT[^4]$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ FLOT *vs* ECF$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ECF
-   EsoPEC: (esophageal):FLOT$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$FLOT *vs* ChemoRT$\rightarrow$Surgery (CROSS)

[^3]: Epirubicin, Cisplatin, 5FU

[^4]: 5FU, Leuvocorin, Oxaliplatin, Decetaxol

## OEO2 Clinical Trial

-   802 Esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell

-   Randomized to Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemo *vs* Surgery alone

-   Chemotherapy with ECF (Epirubicin, Cisplatin, 5FU)

-   5-year survival 23% for chemo+surgery vs 17% for surgery (HR 0.84 p=0.03)

## EsoPEC Trial

-   Esophageal cancer

-   Randomized to CROSS vs FLOT

-   Better survival with FLOT

## Metastatic

FOLFOX is first-line systemic therapy for metastatic GI cancers

-   Dose-limiting toxicity is frequently peripheral neuropathy
