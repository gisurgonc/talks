## Literature

### Body composition and Racial/Ethnic differences

Investigators at the University of Illinois {@jang557} examined the change in skeletal muscle index during cancer treatment among 212 patients. Among 132 non-Hispanic Black patients, muscle loss during therapy was greater than non-Hispanic White and Other (Asian + Hispanic) (Odds Ratio 3.29 p=0.004). The loss was highest in Black rectal cancer patients (11 units of SMI loss cm2/m2) vs White rectal Cancer (8 cm2/m2). Loss among colon cancer patients was higher in Black patients ( 5.5 cm2/m2) than in White patients (2.5 cm2/m2). Prior to treatment, Blacks had higher SMI than White (similar to findings of Xaio 2019)
