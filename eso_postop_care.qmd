## Esophagectomy Complications

-   Delayed gastric emptying
-   Aspiration due to dysphagia
-   Anastomotic leak (8%)
-   Pneumonia (10%)
-   Atrial Fibrillation (20%)
-   Myocardial Infarction (5%)
-   Chylothorax (5%)

## Gastric emptying after Esophagectomy

Vagus nerve normally stimulates gastric emptying

Esophagectomy require dividing the vagus nere

$\Rightarrow$ Esophagectomy can cause delayed gastric emptying

-   Nasogastric tube decompresses gastric conduit
- Radiology test to determine when NG can be removed

## Evaluation of Gastric Emptying

Upper GI evaluates gastric emptying

-   Initial study on POD #2/3/4
-   Patient stands in fluoroscopy
-   Isovue injected via NG tube

If stomach empties well $\rightarrow$ NG tube removed

If stomach does not empty $\rightarrow$ repeat study in 2 days

## Swallowing Evaluation

30% of patients have abnormal swallowing after esophagectomy

$\rightarrow$ at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

Due to disuse atrophy of swallowing muscles

-   Advanced age
-   Prolonged NPO after surgery
-   NPO prior to surgery due to esophageal obstruction

## Swallowing Evaluation

Modified Barium Swallow performed after NG tube removed

Outcomes:

-   Pass for all consistencies (no aspiration or penetration) - 70%
-   Aspiration of thin liquids but OK for moderately thick liquinds - 15%
-   Aspiration witn moderately thick liquids - 15%

## Modified Barium Swallow -Pass

70% Pass - started with oral liquids 1oz/hour

-   Advanced to protein shakes 2oz/hour if water tolerated
-   Advanced to protein shakes 4oz/hour if tolerated

Patients discharged taking water, Gatorade, and protein shakes orally



## Modified Barium Swallow - Fail

Cleared for moderately thick but aspiration with thin:

- NPO
- Medicines with a sip of thickened water

Aspiration with moderately thick liquids:

- NPO
- Medicines administered via jejunostomy tube

MBS is repeated every 3-4 days until discharge


## Anastomotic Leak

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

## Anastomotic Leak

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
If healing of anastomosis doesn't occur:

-   Leakage of fluid from the esophagus
-   Mediastinitis
-   Amylase can be detected in drain fluid
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Thoracic Anastomotic Leak

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
If leak occurs:

-   Some leaks will seal with conservative management
-   Stent may be required to help healing
-   Additional surgery rarely required

## Drain Amylase for Leak Detection

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Thoracic anastomosis

-   Usually leaks into the right chest
    -   JP#2 drains the right chest

Cerfical anastomosis

-   Usually leaks into the neck
    -   JP#4 drains the neck incision

Usually start checking drain amylase on 4th-8th postop days
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/Eso_IvorLewis_Leak.png)
:::
:::::

## CT esophagram to detect Thoracic Anastomotic Leak

Pre-contrast CT scan performed without contrast

Water-soluble contrast instilled in the esophagus

Constast CT scan peformed

Radiologist looks for contrast extravisation from esophagus

## CT Esophagram with NG tube in place

CT esophagram sentivity is best if side-holes of NG tube are immediately adjacent to the anastomosis

Side-holes extend 8.5cm up from the tip of the NG tube

Best position of NG tube is with tip 5cm below the anastomosis

$\Rightarrow$ NG tube needs to be optimally positioned **prior** to contrast instillation

Once patient is positioned on the CT scanner:

-   "Scout" scan peformed to identify location of tip of NG tube relative to the anastomosis
-   Radiologist will measure the distance from the anastomosis to the tip of the NG tube.
-   NG tube is then withdrawn a distance which keeps the NG tube tip 5cm *below* the anastomosis.
  -   If NG tube tip is 13cm below anastomosis, NG tube is withdrawn 13 - 6 = 7cm
-   NG tube manipulation will need to be done by an RN or physician

## NG Tube Withdrawl - AMT Bridle

NG tubes are kept in place with an AMT bridle. A locking plastic clip holds the NG tube.

In order to open the locking clip, a guitar pick (or a thumbnai) is used to pry open the clip.

The NG tube can then be withdrawn the required distance

After CT Esophagram, NG tube can be (blindly) advanced to prior position

Ideal position is with all 4 dots outside the nose

## CT esophagram - Full Sequence

Scout CT Scan obtained and NG position measured

NG tube withdrawn by RN/physicin

Pre-contrast CT scan performed without contrast

Water-soluble contrast instilled in the esophagus

Constast CT scan peformed

NG tube returned to prior position

## CT Esophagram without NG tube

For patients who have had their NG tube removed, oral contrast can be given for CT esophagram *if* they have passed their Modified Barium Swallow.

For patients who have their NG removed and have not been cleared for thin liquids by Modified Barium Swallow, CT esophagram carries a risk of aspiration.

$\Rightarrow$ NG tube removal is delayed for patients with:

-   Elevated drain amylase
-   Leukocytosis
-   Fevers
-   Prolonged ventilation

... until CT esophagram confirms that there is no evidence of leak


## Leak Detection with Cervical Anastomosis

Leak is generally clinically apparent:

-   Elevated drain amylase (JP#4)
-   Cloudy drain fluid
-   Cervical wound infection

Barium upper GI best study to look for leak


## Pneumonia

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Pneumonia occurs in 10% of patients after esophagectomy.

-   Normal muscle mass: Risk 5%
-   Low muscle mass (<25 %ile): Risk 20%

## Preventing Pneumonia

Clearance of oropharygeal secretions::

-   Deep breathing
-   Coughing
-   Walking

After surgery, this means:

-   Sitting in a chair most of the day
-   Walking in the halls as soon as possible

## Atrial arrhythmia

Atrial fibrillation (and other arrhythmias)

Prevention – beta blockade/amiodarone

- Metoprolol 2.5mg IV q6 hours
  - Can increase to 5mg IV
  - Convert to 25-50mg enteral q12 hours 

Diagnosis – EKG monitoring

Treatment – amiodarone, $\uparrow$β blockade


## Risks of Cervical Anastomosis - Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Palsy

-   Hoarse voice
-   Diagnosis by FEES (speech therapy)
-   Risk of aspiration

RLN palsy generally improves over time

May require medialization of the affected cord

## Risks of Surgery

|                     | Age \<75 | Age \>75 |
|---------------------|:--------:|:--------:|
| Normal Muscle (75%) |    2%    |   10%    |
| Low Muscle (25%)    |   10%    |   30%    |

: Risks of Death within 90 Days of Surgery

## Thoracic Epidural Catheter

-   Managed by Anesthesia Pain Service
-   Foley catheter removed after epidural out
-   Can cause hypotension due to sympathectomy effect

## Urinary Rention with Epidural Catheter

Randomized trial of early vs late removal of urinary catheter after thoracic surgery

Early removal at 48hrs: 12% reinsertion

-   One urinary tract infection

Removal 6 hours after epidural removal: 3.2% reinsertion

-   No urinary tract infection in 126 patients

## Urinary Rention with Epidural Catheter

Early urinary removal catheter protocol (48hrs) compared with historical controls

Early removal at 48hrs: 28% retention

-   Urinary tract infection 1%

Removal 6 hours after epidural removal: 12.4% retention (p=0.003)

-   Uninary tract infection 3.2% (p=0.28)

## Multimodality Pain Management

-   Morphine or Dilaudid PCA
-   Acetaminophen 1000mg q6 hours ATC (not prn)
-   Gabapentin 300mg tid
-   Oxycodone (elixir via jejunostomy or tablets)
-   No Toradol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories


## Jejunostomy Small Bowel Necrosis

Among patients with a new jejunostomy tube: 

- 1% incidence of necrosis (gangrene) of the jejunum
- Due to demand ischemia 
- Can lead to bowel perforation 
- More likely after major surgery

## Jejunal Necrosis - Cincinnati Series

Eight patients over 14 years age 50-74

-   Pancreatectomy (n=6)
-   Esophagectomy (n=2)

Presentation 4 days after starting feeds

Symptoms:

-   Abdominal pain and distension
-   Tachycardia
-   Hypotension
-   Leukocytosis

Key lessons:

-   Early diagnosis is critical. **Stop Tube Feeds!**
-   Signs can be subtle: distension or $\uparrow$ pain
-   CT scan is diagnostic
-   Advance tube feeds slowly until bowel function
-   Critical period is probably first 5 days postop

## Nutritional Consequences of Esophagectomy

Oropharyngeal

-   Dsyphagia and aspiration due to muscle wasting

Gastric

-   Small capacity of gastric conduit
-   Delayed gastric emptying

Intestinal - Tube feeding intolerance

If That’s Not Enough… 

- Increased metabolic needs due to healing + 
- Preoperative nutritional deficit

## Gastric Emptying - Medical Strategies

Metoclopramine (Reglan®) – 10mg po/iv q6hrs

-   Side effects
    -   Dystonic reaction (esp in young)
    -   Tardive Dyskinesia (\<1%)

Mirtazapine (Remeron®) 15mg po qHs

- Anti-depressant 
- Promotes gastric emptying 
- Can cause vivid dreams

## Jejunostomy Feedings

Osmolite 1.5 starting POD#1 at 30mL/hr

-   Increased once bowel function returns (flatus)
-   Increased 10mL/hour every 12 hours (continuous)
-   Converted to nocturnal (6pm to 10am)

Vital High Protein for BMI \>35 (decreased CHO/calorie content, increased protein)

## Jejunostomy Feedings

Five cans = 75mL/hour x 16 hours (4pm-10am)

Free Water Flushes

- Prevents tube clogging, constipation, hypernatremia
- Flush tube in am after running feeds
- 240mL q4 hours while awake (qid)

## Osmolite 1.5

Nutritionally complete standard formula

- High caloric density 
- Does not contain fiber 
  - Reduces risk of clogging tube 
- Medium Chain Triglycerides (20%) 
- HCPCS Code: B4152

## Vital 1.5

Nutritionally complete elemental formula 

- Appropriate for malabsorption or diarrhea 
- Contains FOS fiber 
  - Promotes healthy gut flora 
  - Proteins enzymatically hydrolyzed 
  - Promotes gastric emptying 
- Medium Chain Triglycerides (50%) 
- HCPCS Code: B4153

## Vital High Protein

Nutritionally Complete elemental Formula 

- Appropriate for patients with BMI \>35 
- Medium Chain Triglyceries (50%) 
- HCPCS Code: B4153 

## Jenunostomy Tube Feed Intolerance

Diarrhea, bloating, or cramps

-Check clostridium Difficile 
-Switch formulas (Osmolite 1.5 →Vital 1.5) 
-Cautious use of anti-motility agents (eg Lomotil)

## Diabetic Patients on Jejunostomy Feeds

May have more problems with elevated blood sugars 

- Food bypasses duodenum
- Reduced release of endogenous isulin

$\Rightarrow$ may need long-acting insulin in the evening when tube feeds started

Example regimen:

- 10 Units 70/30 at 6 pm 
- 10 Units 70/30 at MN

$\Rightarrow$ Early consultations with endocrinology

## Diabetic Patients - Transition to Nocturnal Feeds

When patients leave the ICU, they will be on continuous tube feeds

Continuous insulin regimen of q6 (2N+1R) 

- eg: 10 units N + 5 units R q6 hours

Most patients will be transitioned to nocturnal feeds when on the ward

## Insulin - Transition to Nocturnal Feeds

Tube feeding regimen will change from 24 hours to 16 hours (6pm-10AM). 

Insulin schedule MUST change with tube feeding schedule due to lack of CHO ingestion when feeds stop:

Tube feeds stopped 12pm & check blood sugar

q6 hr insulin discontinued when tube feeds stopped

Noon dose of insulin is held

Nocturnal tube feeds started at 6pm

Nocturnal insulin given at 6pm as ordered

Nocturnal insulin given at MN if ordered

$\Rightarrwo$ Requires coordination between surgical and endocrinology teams and nursing

## Oral Nutrition

Once cleared for liquids by MBS

- Water 1oz q hour orally 
- Medications switched to oral
- Protein shakes 2oz at a time if tolerated
- Protein shakes 4oz at a time if tolerated

## Diet Orders

In general, fresh post-op esophagectomy patients are NOT ordered for clear liquids or full liquids. Instead, they are ordered for “Tube Feeding (Optional Tray)” and their oral liquids are designated under “Supplements” on the order pane.

When patient is advanced to protein shakes:

- Supplement Task Order is noted as "Supplement Regimen" and comes up as a nursing task, up to TID 

## Diet Orders

Patients who are cleared for nectar thick on MBS (but are not cleared for thin liquids) are kept NPO and are given medicines with sips of thickened water.

Patients who fail for nectar thick liquids are kept NPO and their medicines are given via jejunostomy tube.

## Diet Orders

NPO Diet Continue Tube Feeds. Under “Special Instructions”, one of the following is entered:

-   Medicines with thickened water
-   Water 1oz per hour + meds with water
-   Ensure High Protein 2oz per hour + Water 1oz per hour + meds with water

The above ordering should be used instead of ‘clear liquid diet’ or ‘full liquid diet’ in the fresh post-op esophagectomy patient.

## Diet Orders Preop NPO

\

Preop NPO Orders

Patients who will return to the OR need an order for “NPO after MN” and their tube feeds should be held at midnight.

## Nutrition Summary

-   Evaluate tolerance to j-tube feeds and make adjustments as necessary (formula, rate/time)
-   Emphasize fluid as the patient transitions to 100% oral/tube hydration
-   Monitor tolerance to full liquids prior to discharge
-   Assure blood sugars are checked & controlled

## Enteral Feeding Bag Details

- Home ePump bags can fit approximately 1000mL (4 cartons) of tube feeding 
- Open system; poured into top of bag 
- All connections should now be EnFit 
- Syringes for water flush 
- Infusion bag/tubing

## Patient Education Needs

Post-esophagectomy diet

Anti-dumping diet

Enteral Feeding

Enteral feeding pump

Medication administration via tube

Free water flushing

Diabetic management

## Discharge POD #6/#7
