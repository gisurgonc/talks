## Esophagectomy Complications

Significant complications

-   Delayed gastric empyting
-   Aspiration due to dysphagia
-   Anastomotic leak (8%)
-   Pneumonia (10%)
-   Atrial Fibrillation (20%)
-   Myocardial Infarction (5%)
-   Chylothorax (5%)


## Gastric emptying after Esophagectomy

Vagus nerve normally stimulates gastric emptying

Esophagectomy require dividing the vagus nere

$\Rightarrow$ Esophagectomy can cause delayed gastric emptying

- Nasogastric tube decompressed gastric conduite

## Evaluation of Gastric Emptying

Upper GI evaluated gastric emptying

- Initial study on POD #2/3/4
- Patient stands in fluoroscopy
- Isovue injected via NG tube

If stomach empties well $\rightarrow$ NG tube removed

If stomach does not empty $\rightarrow$ repeat study in 2 days

## Swallowing Evaluation

30% of patients have abnormal swallowing after esophagectomy, which places them at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

Likely due to disuse atrophy of swallowing muscles

- Advanced age
- Prolonged NPO after surgery
- NPO prior to surgery due to esophageal obstruction

## Swallowing Evaluation

Modified Barium Swallow performed after NG tube removed

Outcomes:

- Pass for all consistencies (no aspiration or penetration) - 70%
- Aspiration of thin liquids but OK for moderately thick liquinds - 15%
- Aspiration witn moderately thick liquids - 15%

## Modified Barium Swallow

70% Pass - started with oral liquids 1oz/hour

  - Advanced to protein shakes 2oz/hour if water tolerated
  - Advanced to protein shakes 4oz/hour if tolerated
  
Patients discharged taking water, Gatorade, and protein shakes orally


## Anastomotic Leak

## Drain Amylase for Leak Detection

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

Thoracic anastomosis

- Usually leaks into the right chest
  - JP#2 drains the right chest
  
Cerfical anastomosis

- Usually leaks into the neck
  - JP#4 drains the neck incision

Usually start checking drain amylase on 4th-8th postop days
:::

![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/Eso_IvorLewis_Leak.png)
:::
:::::

## CT esophagram to detect Anastomotic Leak

Pre-contrast CT scan performed without contrast

Water-soluble contrast instilled in the esophagus

Constast CT scan peformed

Radiologist looks for contrast extravisation from esophagus

## CT Esophagram with NG tube in place

CT esophagram sentivity is best if side-holes of NG tube are immediately adjacent to the anastomosis

Sideholes extend 8.5cm up from the tip of the NG tube

Best position of NG tube is with tip 5cm below the anastomosis

$\Rightarrow$ NG tube needs to be optimally positioned **prior** to contrast instillation

Once patient is positioned on the CT scanner:

- "Scout" scan peformed to identify location of tip of NG tube relative to the anastomosis
- Radiologist will measure the distance from the anastomosis to the tip of the NG tube.
- NG tube is then withdrawn a distance which keeps the NG tube tip 5cm *below* the anastomosis. 
- If NG tube tip is 13cm below anastomosis, NG tube is withdrawn 113 - 6 = 7cm
- NG tube manipulation will need to be done by an RN or physician

## NG Tube Withdrawl - AMT Bridle

NG tubes are kept in place with an AMT bridle.  A locking plastic clip holds the NG tube.

In order to open the locking clip, a guitar pick (or a thumbnai) is used to pry open the clip.

The NG tube can then be withdrawn the required distance

After CT Esophagram, NG tube can be (blindly) advanced to prior position

Ideal position is with all 4 dots outside the nose

## CT esophagram - Full Sequence

Scout CT Scan obtained and NG position measured

NG tube withdrawn by RN/physicin

Pre-contrast CT scan performed without contrast

Water-soluble contrast instilled in the esophagus

Constast CT scan peformed

NG tube returned to prior position

## CT Esophagram without NG tube

For patients who have had their NG tube removed, oral contrast can be given for CT esophagram *if* they have passed their Modified Barium Swallow.

For patients who have their NG removed and have not been cleared for thin liquids by Modified Barium Swallow, CT esophagram carries a risk of aspiration.

$\Rightarrow$ NG tube removal is delayed for patients with:

- Elevated drain amylase
- Leukocytosis
- Fevers
- Prolonged ventilation

... until CT esophagram confirms that there is no evidence of leak


## Pneumonia

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Pneumonia occurs in 10% of patients after esophagectomy.

  - Risk 5% in a patients with normal muscle mass
  - Risk 20% in patients with low muscle mass

## Preventing Pneumonia

Several ways to help prevent pneumonia:

-   Deep breathing
-   Coughing
-   Walking

After surgery, this means:

-   Sitting in a chair most of the day
-   Walking in the halls as soon as possible

## Atrial arrhythmia


Atrial fibrillation (and other arrhythmias)
Prevention – beta blockade/amiodarone
Diagnosis – EKG monitoring
Treatment – amiodarone, β blockade

## Risks of Cervical Anastomosis

Leak

- Elevated drain amylase (JP#4)
- Cloudy drain fluid
- Cervical wound infection

Leak can frequently be treated by opening neck incision at the bedside

## Risks of Cervical Anastomosis

Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy

- Hoarse voice
- Diagnosis by FEES (speech therapy)
- Risk of aspiration

RLN palsy generally improves over time

May require medialization of the affected cord



## Risks of Surgery

Risks related to Surgery

-   Anastomotic leak (5%)
-   Stricture at anastomosis (15%)
-   Death within 90 days of surgery
    -   Low risk patients = 2%
    -   Intermediate risk = 10%
    -   High risk = 30%

## Risks of Surgery

|                     | Age \<75 | Age \>75 |
|---------------------|:--------:|:--------:|
| Normal Muscle (75%) |    2%    |   10%    |

Drain Amylase
If an anastomotic leak occurs, salivary gland amylase can be detected in the drain output.
This is a very sensitive test for anastomotic leak
Amylase level from drains starting on POD #3
Cervical anastomosis → JP#4
Thoracic anastomosis → JP#2
Esophagectomy Drains
If a leak occurs after a transthoracic (Ivor Lewis) esophagectomy, it will almost always occur into the RIGHT chest. Drain amylase is always checked from JP2 (which is in the right chest)
Evaluation for Anastomotic Leak
Clinical – Anastomotic leak is generally accompanied by signs of inflammation
Fever
Leukocytosis (>12,000)
CRP (Persistently >25)
Among 30 CMC patients with normal drain amylase and normal WBC, only 1 patient experienced a leak.
CT esophagram
CT esophagram is the most sensitive test for leak with thoracic (not cervical) anastomosis
Performed POD#7 (and weekly in hospitalized pts)
	if WBC >12 OR drain amylase >800IU/ml
Precontrast scan performed
Oral OR NG contrast administered
Post-constrast scan performed
NG tube may need to be temporarily withdrawn several inches just prior to scan to help contrast reach the correct areas

Nasogastric Tube Side Holes
CT Esophagram
NG Bridle
Cervical Anastomosis
Cervical anastomosis is evaluated for leak:
Drain amylase
Signs of infection of cervical incision
Barium swallow (done with barium to avoid risk of aspiration water-soluble contrast)

Nutritional Consequences of Esophagectomy
Oropharyngeal
Dsyphagia and aspiration due to muscle wasting
Gastric
Small capacity of gastric conduit
Delayed emptying
Intestinal
Tube feeding intolerance

If That’s Not Enough…
Increased metabolic needs due to healing

Nutritional Consequences of Esophagectomy
Oropharyngeal
Dsyphagia and aspiration due to muscle wasting
Gastric
Small capacity of gastric conduit

Gastric Emptying
Vagus nerve normally stimulates gastric emptying
Gastric mobilization requires dividing the vagus nerve

→ Esophagectomy patients tend to have delayed gastric emptying
Gastric Emptying
Medical Strategies
Metoclopramine (Reglan®) – 10mg po/iv q6hrs
Side effects 	Dystonic reaction (esp in young)
 			Tardive Dyskinesia (<1%)
Mirtazapine (Remeron®) 15mg po qHs
Anti-depressant promotes gastric emptying
Can cause vivid dreams
Evaluation of Gastric Conduit Emptying
Upper GI – used to determine gastric emptying
Initial study POD#2 – POD#4
Patient stands in fluoroscopy
Isovue (or barium) injected via NG (or oral)

If stomach empties well → NG removed

If stomach empties poorly → NG remains in place
	repeat Upper GI in 2-3 days

Evaluation for Gastric Emptying
Nasogastric tubes placed in the OR
Upper GI Series performed to look for adequate gastric emptying starting POD #2 if patient is otherwise ready for oral intake
Only performed once anastomotic leak ruled out
Patient needs to be able to stand
NG tube removed once emptying demonstrated
If emptying poor →NG tube stays in and study repeated 2 days later

Jejunostomy Feeding Tubes
Jejunostomy tubes placed after all esophagectomy

Gastrostomy tubes may be placed preoperatively in patients who will have an esophagectomy in the future.

Patients with a preop gastrostomy may need to adjust to jejunostomy feeds, i.e. pump feeds (vs bolus), or tolerance to a new formula. 

Jejunostomy Feeding Tube
Jejunostomy Tube
14Fr
Jejunostomy Tube Feeds
Nocturnal Jejunostomy Tube Feeds
Typically 60-75mL/hr overnight for 16 hours
Jejunostomy tube flushed in am
Free water flushes
240mL 4x daily 
Free water can help prevent tube clogging, constipation, and tolerance issues 
Jejunostomy tube flushing keeps the lifeline alive
Jejunostomy Feedings
Jejunostomy Tube Feeds 
Osmolite 1.5 starting POD#1 at 30mL/hr
	Increased to goal over first 5 days
Vital High Protein for BMI >35 (decreased CHO/calorie content, increased protein) 

Four cans = 60mL/hour x 16 hours (4pm-8am)
Five cans = 75mL/hour x 16 hours (4pm-18am)
Free Water Flushes
Patients can tolerate up to approximately 240mL (8oz) warm water bolus via syringe into j-tube at a time. 

Please bolus water q4 hours while patient is awake (8AM, 12PM, 4PM, 8PM)
Instruct patients while flushing water on how to do this themselves (for home)
Osmolite 1.5

Nutritionally complete standard formula
High caloric density 
Does not contain fiber

Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy
Nutrition
Jenunostomy Tube Feed Tolerance
Diarrhea
Check clostridium Difficile
Switch formulas (Osmolite 1.5 →Vital 1.5)
Cautious use of anti-motility agents (eg Lomotil)
Hyperglycemia
	Begin diabetic teaching early
	Home insulin preferred to diabetic formulas

Jejunostomy Tube Feeds
Diabetic patients may have more problems with elevated blood sugars with jejunostomy feedings vs oral intake
Due to food bypassing the duodenum and failing to stimulate pancreas through GI hormones
Patients with diabetes may need long-acting insulin in the evening when tube feeds started
Example regimen:  
10 Units 70/30 at 4 pm AND 10 Units 70/30 at 10pm
Early consultations with endocrinology
Transitioning to Nocturnal Tube Feeds
When patients leave the ICU, they will be on continuous tube feeds
Patients with diabetes will have a continuous regimen of q6 (2N+1R)
eg: 10 units N + 5 units R q6 hours 

Most patients will be transitioned to nocturnal feeds when moving to ward 
Insulin when Transitioning to Nocturnal Tube Feeds
Tube feeding regimen will change from 24 hours to 16 hours (6pm-10AM). 
Insulin schedule MUST change with tube feeding schedule due to lack of CHO ingestion during the time off feeds. 
Stop tube feeds at 12pm & check blood sugar
Do not give noon dose of insulin
Discontinue q6 insulin when tube feeds stopped
Start nocturnal tube feeds at 6pm 
Administer nocturnal insulin at 6pm as ordered
Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy
Nutrition
Oral Diet
Begin Ensure High Protein after passing MBS for THIN liquids
Sips of water 1oz q hour  OR Ensure High Protein 4oz q2 hrs
Reglan, Remeron
CMC Home Infusion has dieticians on staff

Patients often go home taking minimal needs orally
Diet Orders
In general, fresh post-op esophagectomy patients are NOT ordered for clear liquids or full liquids. Instead, they are ordered for “Tube Feeding (Optional Tray)” and their oral liquids are designated under “Supplements” on the order pane.  

Patients who pass their MBS for thin liquids are started on oral water 1oz per hour with medicines with sips of water. If oral water is tolerated, they are advanced the following day to Ensure High Protein 2oz q1hr (and continue with water 1oz per hour).

Supplement Task Order is noted as "Supplement Regimen" and comes up as a nursing task, up to TID 
Diet Orders
Patients who are cleared for nectar thick on MBS (but are not cleared for thin liquids) are kept NPO and are given medicines with sips of thickened water.
Patients who fail for nectar thick liquids are kept NPO and their medicines are given via jejunostomy tube.

Diet Orders
NPO Diet Continue Tube Feeds. Under “Special Instructions”, one of the following is entered:
Medicines with thickened water
Water 1oz per hour + meds with water
Ensure High Protein 2oz per hour + Water 1oz per hour + meds with water

The above ordering should be used instead of ‘clear liquid diet’ or ‘full liquid diet’ in the fresh post-op esophagectomy patient.


Preop NPO Orders
Patients who will return to the OR need an order for “NPO after MN” and their tube feeds should be held at midnight.

Nutrition Summary / Action Points
Evaluate tolerance to j-tube feeds and make adjustments as necessary (formula, rate/time) 
Emphasize fluid as the patient transitions to 100% oral/tube hydration 
Monitor tolerance to full liquids prior to discharge 
Assure blood sugars are checked & controlled
