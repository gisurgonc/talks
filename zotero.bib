  abstract = {Oesophageal cancer is a debilitating disease with a poor prognosis, and weight loss owing to malnutrition prevails in the majority of patients. Cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome characterized by the loss of fat and skeletal muscle mass and systemic inflammation arising from complex host-tumour interactions is a major contributor to malnutrition, which is a determinant of tolerance to treatment and survival. In patients with oesophageal cancer, cachexia is further compounded by eating difficulties owing to the stage and location of the tumour, and the effects of neoadjuvant therapy. Treatment with curative intent involves exceptionally extensive and invasive surgery, and the subsequent anatomical changes often lead to eating difficulties and severe postoperative malnutrition. Thus, screening for cachexia by means of percentage weight loss and BMI during the cancer trajectory and survivorship periods is imperative. Additionally, markers of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein), dysphagia and appetite loss should be assessed at diagnosis. Routine assessments of body composition are also necessary in patients with oesophageal cancer to enable assessment of skeletal muscle loss, which might be masked by sarcopenic obesity in these patients. A need exists for clinical trials examining the effectiveness of therapeutic and physical-activity-based interventions in mitigating muscle loss and counteracting cachexia in these patients.},

  abstract = {Cancers are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the number of new cases is expected to rise significantly over the next decades. At the same time, all types of cancer treatment, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and pharmacological therapies are improving in sophistication, precision and in the power to target specific characteristics of individual cancers. Thus, while many cancers may still not be cured they may be converted to chronic diseases. All of these treatments, however, are impeded or precluded by the frequent development of malnutrition and metabolic derangements in cancer patients, induced by the tumor or by its treatment. These evidence-based guidelines were developed to translate current best evidence and expert opinion into recommendations for multi-disciplinary teams responsible for identification, prevention, and treatment of reversible elements of malnutrition in adult cancer patients. The guidelines were commissioned and financially supported by ESPEN and by the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer (EPAAC), an EU level initiative. Members of the guideline group were selected by ESPEN to include a range of professions and fields of expertise. We searched for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and comparative studies based on clinical questions according to the PICO format. The evidence was evaluated and merged to develop clinical recommendations using the GRADE method. Due to the deficits in the available evidence, relevant still open questions were listed and should be addressed by future studies. Malnutrition and a loss of muscle mass are frequent in cancer patients and have a negative effect on clinical outcome. They may be driven by inadequate food intake, decreased physical activity and catabolic metabolic derangements. To screen for, prevent, assess in detail, monitor and treat malnutrition standard operating procedures, responsibilities and a quality control process should be established at each institution involved in treating cancer patients. All cancer patients should be screened regularly for the risk or the presence of malnutrition. In all patients - with the exception of end of life care - energy and substrate requirements should be met by offering in a step-wise manner nutritional interventions from counseling to parenteral nutrition. However, benefits and risks of nutritional interventions have to be balanced with special consideration in patients with advanced disease. Nutritional care should always be accompanied by exercise training. To counter malnutrition in patients with advanced cancer there are few pharmacological agents and pharmaconutrients with only limited effects. Cancer survivors should engage in regular physical activity and adopt a prudent diet.},

As there are no such data in patients with oesophagogastric cancer (OGC), this study investigated changes in body composition in OGC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS: OGC patients who had CT scans before and after NAC were studied. CT images at the L3 vertebral level were analysed using SliceOmatic(\textregistered ) software to derive estimates of FFM and fat mass (FM). Comparisons were made between pre- and post-NAC CT images. Data are reported as mean~{$\pm~$}SD. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (34 male) aged 63~{$\pm~$}12 years were studied and 79\% completed their course of NAC. The interval between CT scans was 107~{$\pm~$}27 days. The proportion of patients with sarcopenia increased from 57\% pre-NAC to 79\% post-NAC (p~=~0.046). During NAC there were significant reductions in estimated FFM and FM (2.9~{$\pm~$}4.7~kg, p~{$<~$}0.0001 and 1.3~{$\pm~$}3.2~kg, p~=~0.007, respectively). No association was demonstrated between loss of FFM and non-completion of NAC, increased hospital stay or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with OGC commencing NAC, sarcopenia was present in 57\%. NAC was associated with further reductions in FFM and an increase in the proportion of patients becoming sarcopenic.},

  abstract = {Though once considered the gold standard, epidural anaesthesia has complications that may be significant and include hypotension, urinary retention, partial or patchy block and, in rare cases, devastating neurological injuries also. Paravertebral block (PVB) is an alternative technique for unilateral surgical procedures like thoracotomy, which may offer similar analgesic effectiveness and a more favourable side-effect profile than epidural analgesia. This systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized clinical trials aims to compare thoracic paravertebral with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in thoracotomy for lung surgery. Five hundred and forty-one patients from 12 clinical trials have been included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. We found that visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at rest and during activity/coughing at 4-8, 24 and 48 h postoperatively were similar in both the PVB and TEA groups. Considering studies not included in the previous meta-analysis, a VAS score on activity at 48 h is significantly better in the PVB group (mean difference 0.40 cm; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 0.77, 0.02; Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) fixed). Hypotension (odds ratio 0.13; 95\% CI 0.06, 0.31; M-H fixed) and urinary retention are more common in the epidural analgesia group. So, we conclude that thoracic PVB may be as effective as thoracic epidural analgesia for post-thoracotomy pain relief and is also associated with fewer complications.},

To evaluate an older adult with cancer, oncologists must understand age-related changes and identify the subset of population who is vulnerable and at risk of cancer treatment toxicity. Comprehensive geriatric assessments focusing on functional status, multimorbidity, nutritional status, cognitive impairment, and psychosocial support help recognize heterogeneity among older adults, leading to individualized approaches toward cancer treatment.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Uncontrolled studies suggest that chemoradiation has similar efficacy as surgery for esophageal cancer. Therefore, a randomized trial was carried out to compare, in responders only, chemoradiation alone with chemoradiation followed by surgery in patients with locally advanced tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had operable T3N0-1M0 thoracic esophageal cancer. Patients received two cycles of fluorouracil (FU) and cisplatin (days 1 to 5 and 22 to 26) and either conventional (46 Gy in 4.5 weeks) or split-course (15 Gy, days 1 to 5 and 22 to 26) concomitant radiotherapy. Patients with response and no contraindication to either treatment were randomly assigned to surgery (arm A) or continuation of chemoradiation (arm B; three cycles of FU/cisplatin and either conventional [20 Gy] or split-course [15 Gy] radiotherapy). Chemoradiation was considered equivalent to surgery if the difference in 2-year survival rate was less than 10\%. RESULTS: Of 444 eligible patients, 259 were randomly assigned; 230 patients (88.8\%) had epidermoid cancer, and 29 (11.2\%) had glandular carcinoma. Two-year survival rate was 34\% in arm A versus 40\% in arm B (hazard ratio for arm B v arm A = 0.90; adjusted P = .44). Median survival time was 17.7 months in arm A compared with 19.3 months in arm B. Two-year local control rate was 66.4\% in arm A compared with 57.0\% in arm B, and stents were less required in the surgery arm (5\% in arm A v 32\% in arm B; P {$<$} .001). The 3-month mortality rate was 9.3\% in arm A compared with 0.8\% in arm B (P = .002). Cumulative hospital stay was 68 days in arm A compared with 52 days in arm B (P = .02). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that, in patients with locally advanced thoracic esophageal cancers, especially epidermoid, who respond to chemoradiation, there is no benefit for the addition of surgery after chemoradiation compared with the continuation of additional chemoradiation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Barrett's oesophagus is one of the most common pre-malignant lesions in the world. Currently the mainstay of therapy is surgical management of advanced cancer but this has improved the five-year survival very little since the 1980s. As a consequence, improved survival relies on early detection through endoscopic surveillance programmes. Success of this strategy relies on the fact that late-stage pre-malignant lesions or very early cancers can be cured by intervention. Currently there is considerable controversy over which method is best: that is conventional open surgery or endotherapy (techniques involving endoscopy). OBJECTIVES: We used data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the effectiveness of endotherapies compared with surgery in people with Barrett's oesophagus, those with early neoplasias (defined as high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and those with early cancer (defined as carcinoma in-situ, superficially invasive, early cancer or superficial cancer T-1m (T1-a) and T-1sm (T1-b)). SEARCH METHODS: We used the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy to identify RCTs in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ISI Web of Science, EBMR, Controlled Trials mRCT and ISRCTN, and LILACS, in July and August 2008. The searches were updated in 2009 and again in April 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: RCTs comparing endotherapies with surgery in the treatment of high-grade dysplasia or early cancer. All cellular types of cancer were included (i.e. adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and more unusual types) but will be discussed separately. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: patients of any age and either gender with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of early neoplasia (HGD and early cancer) in Barrett's or squamous lined oesophagus. Types of interventions; endotherapies (the intervention) compared with surgery (the control), all with curative intent. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Reports of studies that meet the inclusion criteria for this review would have been analysed using the methods detailed in Appendix 9. MAIN RESULTS: We did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria. In total we excluded 13 studies that were not RCTs but that compared surgery and endotherapies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This Cochrane review has indicated that there are no RCTs to compare management options in this vital area, therefore trials should be undertaken as a matter of urgency. The problems with such randomised methods are standardising surgery and endotherapies in all sites, standardising histopathology in all centres, assessing which patients are fit or unfit for surgery and making sure there are relevant outcomes for the study (i.e. long-term survival (over five or more years)) and no progression of HGD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Esophageal endoscopic ultrasound is now regarded as essential in the staging of esophageal carcinoma. There is an increasing trend toward endoluminal therapies (ie, endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation) for pre-cancer or early-stage cancers because of concerns of high morbidity associated with esophagectomy. This study reviews our institutional experience with preoperative endoscopic ultrasound staging of early esophageal cancers in patients who underwent an esophagectomy to evaluate the accuracy of staging by endoscopic ultrasound and how this affects treatment recommendations. METHODS: A prospective esophagectomy database of all patients undergoing an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer at a single high-volume institution was retrospectively reviewed for patients with early-stage esophageal cancer. This study analyzed patients with clinical Tis to T1 disease, as predicted by preoperative endoscopic ultrasound, and correlated this with the pathologic stages after esophagectomy. The surgical outcomes were evaluated to assess the safety of esophagectomy as a treatment modality. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2011, 107 patients (93 male, 14 female) with a mean age of 66 years (range, 39-91 years) were staged by preoperative endoscopic ultrasound to have esophageal high-grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or T1 cancer and underwent an esophagectomy. Tumor depth was correctly staged by endoscopic ultrasound in only 39\% (23/59) of pT1a tumors (invading into the lamina propria or muscularis mucosa) and 51\% (18/35) of pT1b tumors (submucosal). Of the endoscopic ultrasound-staged cT1a-lpN0 lesions, there were positive lymph nodes in 15\% of pathologic specimens (2/13). Patients with pT1a-mm lesions had a 9\% rate of pathologic lymph node involvement (1/11), and those with pT1b tumors had a 17\% rate of lymph node spread (6/35). Esophagectomy was performed in all 107 patients with a 30-day mortality rate of less than 1\% (1/107). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic ultrasound for determining true pathologic staging are poor for early-stage esophageal cancers. Lesions thought to be cT1a-lpN0 by endoscopic ultrasound have at least pN1 disease in 15\% of cases. Endoluminal therapy of these lesions based on endoscopic ultrasound undertreats a significant number of patients. Esophagectomy is still the standard therapy for early-stage esophageal cancers in the majority of patients.},

However, in esophageal cancer patients the radiation dose to the heart is usually markedly higher. To determine whether radiation-induced cardiac toxicity is also a relevant issue for this group, we conducted a review of the current literature. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline for papers concerning cardiac toxicity in esophageal cancer patients treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall crude incidence of symptomatic cardiac toxicity was as high as 10.8\%. Toxicities corresponded with several dose-volume parameters of the heart. The most frequently reported complications were pericardial effusion, ischemic heart disease and heart failure. CONCLUSION: Cardiac toxicity is a relevant issue in the treatment of esophageal cancer. However, valid Normal Tissue Complication Probability models for esophageal cancer are not available at present.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Surgical stress in the presence of fasting worsens the catabolic state, causes insulin resistance and may delay recovery. Carbohydrate rich drinks given preoperatively may ameliorate these deleterious effects. A systematic review was undertaken to analyse the effect of preoperative carbohydrate loading on insulin resistance, gastric emptying, gastric acidity, patient wellbeing, immunity and nutrition following surgery. METHODS: All studies identified through PubMed until September 2011 were included. References were cross-checked to ensure capture of cited pertinent articles. RESULTS: Overall, 17 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1,445 patients who met the inclusion criteria were identified. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks significantly improved insulin resistance and indices of patient comfort following surgery, especially hunger, thirst, malaise, anxiety and nausea. No definite conclusions could be made regarding preservation of muscle mass. Following ingestion of carbohydrate drinks, no adverse events such as apparent or proven aspiration during or after surgery were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of oral carbohydrate drinks before surgery is probably safe and may have a positive influence on a wide range of perioperative markers of clinical outcome. Further studies are required to determine its cost effectiveness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the relation between hospital volume and surgical mortality is well established, for most procedures, the relative importance of the experience of the operating surgeon is uncertain. METHODS: Using information from the national Medicare claims data base for 1998 through 1999, we examined mortality among all 474,108 patients who underwent one of eight cardiovascular procedures or cancer resections. Using nested regression models, we examined the relations between operative mortality and surgeon volume and hospital volume (each in terms of total procedures performed per year), with adjustment for characteristics of the patients and other characteristics of the providers. RESULTS: Surgeon volume was inversely related to operative mortality for all eight procedures (P=0.003 for lung resection, P{$<$}0.001 for all other procedures). The adjusted odds ratio for operative death (for patients with a low-volume surgeon vs. those with a high-volume surgeon) varied widely according to the procedure--from 1.24 for lung resection to 3.61 for pancreatic resection. Surgeon volume accounted for a large proportion of the apparent effect of the hospital volume, to an extent that varied according to the procedure: it accounted for 100 percent of the effect for aortic-valve replacement, 57 percent for elective repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, 55 percent for pancreatic resection, 49 percent for coronary-artery bypass grafting, 46 percent for esophagectomy, 39 percent for cystectomy, and 24 percent for lung resection. For most procedures, the mortality rate was higher among patients of low-volume surgeons than among those of high-volume surgeons, regardless of the surgical volume of the hospital in which they practiced. CONCLUSIONS: For many procedures, the observed associations between hospital volume and operative mortality are largely mediated by surgeon volume. Patients can often improve their chances of survival substantially, even at high-volume hospitals, by selecting surgeons who perform the operations frequently.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: This study investigated the effects of nutritional support on postoperative complications, in relation with demographic and nutritional factors, intraoperative factors, type and routes of nutritional regimens. METHODS: A series of 1410 subjects underwent major abdominal surgery for gastrointestinal cancer and received various types of nutritional support: standard intravenous fluids (SIF; n=149), total parenteral nutrition (TPN; n=368), enteral nutrition (EN; n=393), and immune-enhancing enteral nutrition (IEEN; n=500). Postoperative complications, considered as major (if lethal or requiring re-operation, or transfer to intensive care unit), or otherwise minor, were recorded. RESULTS: Major and minor complications occurred in 101 (7.2\%) and 446 (31.6\%) patients, respectively. Factors correlated with postoperative complications at multivariate analysis were pancreatic surgery, (p{$<$}0.001), advanced age (p=0.002), weight loss (p=0.019), low serum albumin (p=0.019) and nutritional support (p=0.001). Nutritional support reduced morbidity versus SIF with an increasing protective effect of TPN, EN, and IEEN. This effect remained valid regardless the severity of risk factors identified at the multivariate analysis and it was more evident by considering infectious complications only. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic surgery, advanced age, weight loss and low serum albumin are independent risk factors for the onset of postoperative complications. Nutritional support, particularly IEEN, significantly reduced postoperative morbidity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been developed to overcome the limitations of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). We aimed to compare the outcomes of these two methods. METHODS: Databases, including Pubmed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, were searched to identify studies comparing ESD with EMR for premalignant and malignant lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. In a meta-analysis, primary end points were the en bloc resection rate and the curative resection rate; secondary end points were operation time, and rates of bleeding, perforation, and local recurrence. RESULTS: 15 nonrandomized studies (seven full-text and eight abstracts) were identified. Meta-analysis showed higher en bloc and curative resection rates (odds ratio [OR] 13.87, 95 \%CI 10.12 - 18.99; OR 3.53, 95 \%CI 2.57 - 4.84) irrespective of lesion size. Subgroup analysis showed higher en bloc and curative resection rates with ESD for esophageal, gastric, and colorectal neoplasms, and for lesions of size {$<$} 10 mm, 10 mm {$<$} 20 mm, and {$>$} 20 mm. Local recurrence was lower with ESD (OR 0.09, 95 \%CI 0.04 - 0.18). But ESD was more time-consuming than EMR (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.76; 95 \%CI 0.60 - 2.92), and showed high procedure-related bleeding and perforation rates (OR 2.20, 95 \%CI 1.58 - 3.07; OR 4.09, 95 \%CI 2.47 - 6.80). CONCLUSIONS: ESD showed better en bloc and curative resection rates and local recurrence compared with EMR, but was more time-consuming and had higher rates of bleeding and perforation complications. These results need to be confirmed by high quality trials and further studies in the west.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Feeding jejunostomy is frequently used to ensure nutritional intake after esophagectomy. Early return to diet is demonstrated to enhance recovery in major abdominal surgery. Early oral feeding is safe and effective in recent randomized controlled trials in esophagectomy. This study assesses the implications of eliminating the insertion of jejunostomy after esophagectomy. METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken between 2014 and 2017 with follow-up over the first year. Fifty patients did not have a jejunostomy, compared with 46 patients who had conventional treatment. Outcomes measured included change in relative weight and body mass over 1 year, complications, and nutritional reinterventions. RESULTS: Median weight loss at 1 year was 10.7 kg (range, -8 to 55.6) whereas median percent weight loss was 12\% (range, -10.1\% to 39.2\%). Patients without jejunostomy lost more weight during the first month (P~= .002). Thereafter, at 6 of 12 months, there were no differences in actual or relative weight loss. Obese patients lost more weight in the group without jejunostomy compared with those who had it (9.9 versus 5 kg; P~= .004). This effect was not seen in normal or overweight patients. Complications were similar, whereas leaks were more common in the jejunostomy group (15.2\% versus 2\%; P~= .019). Nutritional reinterventions were similar during index admission and subsequent readmissions (7 versus 5 patients; P~= .640). CONCLUSIONS: Routine jejunostomy use delays rather than prevents weight loss after esophagectomy. Oral route nutrition allows patients to maintain sufficient nutrition and does not increase complications or requirement for nutritional interventions after surgery. Routine use of jejunostomy may not be required in modern practice.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Postoperative pulmonary complications can be a devastating consequence of surgery. Validated strategies to reduce these adverse outcomes are needed. OBJECTIVES: To design, implement, and determine the efficacy of a suite of interventions for reducing postoperative pulmonary complications. DESIGN: A before-after trial comparing our National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) pulmonary outcomes before and after implementing I COUGH, a multidisciplinary pulmonary care program. SETTING: An urban, academic, safety-net hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All patients who underwent general or vascular surgery at our institution during a 1-year period before and after implementation of I COUGH. INTERVENTIONS: A multidisciplinary team developed a strategy to reduce pulmonary complications based on comprehensive patient and family education and a set of standardized electronic physician orders to specify early postoperative mobilization and pulmonary care. Designated by the acronym I COUGH, the program emphasizes incentive spirometry, coughing and deep breathing, oral care (brushing teeth and using mouthwash twice daily), understanding (patient and family education), getting out of bed at least 3 times daily, and head-of-bed elevation. Nursing and physician education promoted a culture of mobilization and I COUGH interventions. I COUGH was implemented for all general surgery and vascular surgery patients at our institution in August 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The NSQIP-reported incidence and risk-adjusted ratios of postoperative pneumonia and unplanned intubation, which NSQIP reports as observed-expected (OE) ratios for the 1-year period before implementing I COUGH and as odds ratios (ORs, statistically comparable to OE ratios) for the period after its implementation. RESULTS: Before implementation of I COUGH, our incidence of postoperative pneumonia was 2.6\%, falling to 1.6\% after its implementation, and risk-adjusted outcomes fell from an OE ratio of 2.13 to an OR of 1.58. The incidence of unplanned intubations was 2.0\% before I COUGH and 1.2\% after I COUGH, with risk-adjusted outcomes decreasing from an OE ratio of 2.10 to an OR of 1.31. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: I COUGH, a standardized postoperative care program emphasizing patient education, early mobilization, and pulmonary interventions, reduced the incidence of postoperative pneumonia and unplanned intubation among our patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CT-RT) before oesophagectomy is standard management for squamous cell carcinoma(SCC) of the thoracic oesophagus. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of patients who had clinical complete response(CR) with neoadjuvant CT-RT + oesophagectomy with the survival of patients who had clinical CR and were not operated on. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven consecutive patients with SCC of the thoracic oesophagus with CR with neoadjuvant CT-RT presenting at the Regional Center of Esophageal Diseases from 1992 to 2008 were included in this retrospective study on a prospectively collected database. Thirty-nine patients underwent oesophagectomy (CT-RT + oesophagectomy), while 38(CT-RT) were not operated on because they were considered unfit for surgery or refused the operation. Patients' outcome and survival were compared. RESULTS: In the CT-RT + oesophagectomy group, clinical CR was confirmed after histological examination of the surgical specimen in 27/39 (69.2 \%) patients. Five-year overall survival rates were 50.0 \% in the CT-RT + oesophagectomy group and 57.0 \% in the CT-RT group (p=0.99); 5-year disease-free survival rates were 55.5\%in the CT-RT + oesophagectomy group and 34.6\%in the CTRT group (p=0.15). Even after adjusting for propensity score, age, ASA and clinical stage, the treatment regimen did not show a statistically significant effect on overall survival (adjusted p=0.65) nor on disease-free survival (adjusted p=0.15). CONCLUSION: In our group of patients with clinical CR after neoadjuvant CT-RT for SCC of the thoracic oesophagus, waiting for recurrence and then using salvage surgery did not negatively impact their survival compared to patients treated with surgery. More accurate restaging protocols are warranted to improve decision making after CR with neoadjuvant CT-RT.},

METHODS: In a multicentre, single-arm open study, patients with proved oesophageal cancer without definite distant metastases and regarded as suitable for potentially curative treatment were examined by PET. Clinicians were requested to supply a management plan before and another plan after being supplied with the PET scan results. Patients were followed for at least 1 year for outcome analysis. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients (104 men, mean age 67 y) were recruited. PET detected additional sites of disease in 53 patients (41\%). Significant changes in management (high or medium impact) were observed in 38\% of patients, primarily as a result of identifying additional sites of disease and/or confirming previously equivocal regional and distant metastases. Progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients found to have additional lesions on PET (p {$<$} 0.05), but was not related to SUV(max). CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the significant impact of PET on the clinical management of patients with newly diagnosed oesophageal carcinoma, and on prognostic stratification of these patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with locoregional carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who underwent preoperative chemoradiation, it is unclear whether survival was better predicted by pretherapy clinical stage or by posttherapy pathologic stage. METHODS: The authors studied 235 consecutive patients with pretherapy clinical Stage II, III, or IVA (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria) carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who were treated with chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy. Posttherapy cancer status was classified using pathologic stage and semiquantitative assessment of residual carcinoma. Clinicopathologic features, residual carcinoma status, and pretherapy and posttherapy stage were compared with disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Posttherapy pathologic stage was Stage 0 in 29\% of patients, Stage I in 11\% of patients, Stage II in 34\% of patients, Stage III in 20\% of patients, and Stage IV in 6\% of patients. Cancer downstaging occurred in 56\% of patients. In univariate analysis, disease-free and overall survival were predicted by posttherapy pathologic stage (both with P {$<$} 0.001), margin status (P = 0.002 and P = 0.01, respectively), extent of residual carcinoma (both with P {$<$} 0.001), and downstaging (both with P = 0.001), but not by age, gender, type of cancer, pretherapy clinical stage, or preoperative regimen. However, in multivariate analysis, disease-free and overall survival were independently predicted by posttherapy pathologic stage (both with P = 0.02). Extent of residual carcinoma was a marginally significant predictor of overall survival (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Posttherapy pathologic stage was the best available predictor of outcome for patients with locoregional carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who underwent chemoradiation therapy followed by esophagectomy. The findings in the current study supported the concept of downstaging by preoperative therapy.},

From July 2000 to December 2004, 80 patients with potentially resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the mid or lower thoracic esophagus were randomized to esophagectomy or chemoradiotherapy. A two-or three-stage esophagectomy with two-field dissection was performed. Patients treated with chemoradiotherapy received continuous 5-.uorouracil infusion (200 mg/m2/day) from day 1 to 42 and cisplatin (60 mg/m2) on days 1 and 22. The tumor and regional lymphatics were concomitantly irradiated to a total of 50\textendash 60 Gy.Tumor response was assessed by endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, and computed tomography scan. Salvage esophagectomy was performed for incomplete response or recurrence. Forty-four patients received standard esophagectomy, whereas 36 were treated with chemoradiotherapy. Median follow-up was 16.9 months. The operative mortality was 6.8\%. The incidence of postoperative complications was 38.6\%. No difference in the early cumulative survival was found between the two groups (RR = 0.89; 95\% confidence interval, 0.37-2.17; log-rank test P =0.45). There was no difference in the disease-free survival. Patients treated with surgery had a slightly higher proportion of recurrence in the mediastinum, whereas those treated with chemoradiation sustained a higher proportion of recurrence in the cervical or abdominal regions. Standard esophagectomy or chemoradiotherapy offered similar early clinical outcome and survival for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. The challenge lies in the detection of residue disease after chemoradiotherapy.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Esophageal cancer (EC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. Mortality and disease stage at diagnosis are important indicators of improvements in cancer prevention and control. We examined United States trends in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) mortality and stage at diagnosis by race and ethnicity. METHODS: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data to identify individuals with histologically confirmed EAC and ESCC between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 2016. For both EAC and ESCC, we calculated age-adjusted mortality and the proportion presenting at each stage by race/ethnicity, sex, and year. We then calculated the annual percent change (APC) in each indicator by race/ethnicity and examined changes over time. RESULTS: The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC\,=\,1.60, p\,=\,0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC\,=\,- 4.53, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSION: We found notable differences in trends in EAC and ESCC mortality and stage at diagnosis by race/ethnicity. Stage migration resulting from improvements in diagnosis and treatment may partially explain recent trends in disease stage at diagnosis. Future efforts should identify factors driving current esophageal cancer disparities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The goal of treatment for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with dysplasia is complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM). The long-term durability of CEIM has not been well characterized, so the frequency and duration of surveillance are unclear. We report results from a 5-year follow-up analysis of patients with BE and dysplasia treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the randomized controlled Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia (AIM) trial. METHODS: Participants for the AIM Dysplasia trial (18-80 years old) were recruited from 19 sites in the United States and had endoscopic evidence of non-nodular dysplastic BE {$\leq$}8~cm in length. Subjects (n~= 127) were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive either RFA (entire BE segment ablated circumferentially) or a sham endoscopic procedure; patients in the sham group were offered RFA treatment 1 year later, and all patients were followed for 5 years. We collected data on BE recurrence (defined as intestinal metaplasia in the tubular esophagus) and dysplastic BE recurrence among patients who achieved CEIM. We constructed Kaplan-Meier estimates and applied parametric survival analysis to examine proportions of patients without any recurrence and without dysplastic recurrence. RESULTS: Of 127 patients in the AIM Dysplasia trial, 119 received RFA and met inclusion criteria. Of those 119, 110 (92\%) achieved CEIM. Over 401 person-years of follow-up (mean, 3.6 years per patient; range, 0.2-5.8 years), 35 of 110 (32\%) patients had recurrence of BE or dysplasia, and 19 (17\%) had dysplasia recurrence. The incidence rate of BE recurrence was 10.8 per 100 person-years overall (95\% CI, 7.8-15.0); 8.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95\% CI, 4.9-14.0), and 13.5 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95\% CI 8.8-20.7). The incidence rate of dysplasia recurrence was 5.2 per 100 person-years overall (95\% CI 3.3-8.2); 3.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95\% CI 1.5-7.2), and 7.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95\%~CI 4.2-12.5). Neither BE nor dysplasia recurred at a constant rate. There was a greater probability of recurrence in the first year following CEIM than in the following 4 years combined. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of prospective cohort data from the AIM Dysplasia trial, we found BE to recur after CEIM by RFA in almost one third of patients with baseline dysplastic disease; most recurrences occurred during the first year after CEIM. However, patients who achieved CEIM and remained BE free at 1 year after RFA had a low risk of BE recurrence. Studies are needed to determine when surveillance can be decreased or discontinued; our study did not identify any BE or dysplasia recurrence after 4 years of surveillance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients often receive induction therapy based on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-identified nodal spread (N1) or deep tumor invasion (T3), although controversy exists regarding the role of induction therapy for early stage disease. We aim to evaluate the reliability of EUS in identifying early stage disease and the subsequent impact on treatment and outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 149 patients who underwent EUS and esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma between January 2000 and December 2008. Computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients, whereas positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in 91\%. Clinical stage (c), pathologic stage (p), operative mortality, and survival were recorded. RESULTS: Unanticipated pathologic nodal disease was similar in patients with cT1N0 and cT2N0 tumors (6/25 [24\%] versus 7/18 [38.8\%]; p=0.6). Among the 18 cases of cT2N0 disease, 9 (50\%) were pathologically staged as T1N0, 8 (44\%) were upstaged to pT3N0-1, and 1 (6\%) was pT2N0. One case of cT1N0 tumor (4\%) was upstaged to pT3N0. Among patients with cT1-2N0 tumors, 5-year disease-free survival for the group that was appropriately staged was 89.8\% versus 39.9\% for the group that had a higher pathologic stage than their clinical stage (ie, {$>$}T2N0) (p{$<$}0.001). Operative mortality for patients with cT1-2N0 tumors was 0/43 (0\%), which was no different from that in the higher clinical stage groups with (1/37, 2.7\%) or without (2/68, 2.9\%) induction therapy (p=0.5). Multivariate analysis identified marked/intense uptake on staging PET (odds ratio, 5.76, 95\%; confidence interval, 1.25 to 26.52; p=0.021) to be a factor predictive of upstaging of cT1-2N0 tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Current staging techniques are inadequate for predicting T1-2N0 disease in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Survival is excellent with operation alone in patients with tumors appropriately staged as T1-2N0, although patients with tumors upstaged to greater than T2N0 have significantly worse survival. Other preoperative factors such as PET uptake may help select patients with cT1-2N0 tumors that will be upstaged at resection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical staging of esophageal cancer has improved with positron-emission tomography/computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound imaging. Despite such progress, small single-center studies have questioned the reliability of clinical staging of T2 N0 esophageal cancer. This study broadly examines the adequacy of clinical staging of T2 N0 disease using The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 810 clinical stage T2 N0 patients from 2002 to 2011, with 58 excluded because of incomplete pathologic staging data. Clinical stage, pathologic stage, and preoperative characteristics were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with upstaging at the time of surgical intervention. RESULTS: Among 752 clinical stage T2 N0 patients, 270 (35.9\%) received induction therapy before the operation. Of 482 patients who went directly to surgical intervention, 132 (27.4\%) were confirmed as pathologic T2 N0, 125 (25.9\%) were downstaged (ie, T0-1 N0), and 225 (46.7\%) were upstaged at the operation (T3-4 N0 or Tany N1-3). Exclusive tumor upstaging (ie, pathologic T3-4 N0) accounted for 41 patients (18.2\%), whereas exclusive nodal upstaging (ie, pathological T1-2 N1-3) accounted for 100 (44.5\%). Combined tumor and nodal upstaging (ie, pathological T3-4 N1-3) accounted for 84 patients (37.3\%). Among patients who received induction therapy, 103 (38.1\%) were upstaged vs 225 (46.7\%) without induction therapy (p = 0.026). Comparing the induction therapy group and the primary surgical group, postoperative 30-day mortality (3.7\% vs 3.7\%, p {$>$} 0.99) and morbidity (46.3\% vs 45\%, p = 0.76) were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in staging techniques, clinical staging of T2 N0 esophageal cancer remains unreliable. Recognizing T2 N0 as a threshold for induction therapy in esophageal cancer, many surgeons have opted to treat T2 N0 disease with induction therapy, even though one-quarter of these patients will be pathologic T1 N0. Although this study demonstrated similar perioperative morbidity and mortality with and without induction therapy, further study is needed to examine the effect of upstaging on long-term survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A regimen of epirubicin, cisplatin, and infused fluorouracil (ECF) improves survival among patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. We assessed whether the addition of a perioperative regimen of ECF to surgery improves outcomes among patients with potentially curable gastric cancer. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction, or lower esophagus to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (250 patients) or surgery alone (253 patients). Chemotherapy consisted of three preoperative and three postoperative cycles of intravenous epirubicin (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and cisplatin (60 mg per square meter) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (200 mg per square meter per day) for 21 days. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: ECF-related adverse effects were similar to those previously reported among patients with advanced gastric cancer. Rates of postoperative complications were similar in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and the surgery group (46 percent and 45 percent, respectively), as were the numbers of deaths within 30 days after surgery. The resected tumors were significantly smaller and less advanced in the perioperative-chemotherapy group. With a median follow-up of four years, 149 patients in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and 170 in the surgery group had died. As compared with the surgery group, the perioperative-chemotherapy group had a higher likelihood of overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.93; P=0.009; five-year survival rate, 36 percent vs. 23 percent) and of progression-free survival (hazard ratio for progression, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.81; P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with operable gastric or lower esophageal adenocarcinomas, a perioperative regimen of ECF decreased tumor size and stage and significantly improved progression-free and overall survival.

  abstract = {AIMS: Selection of patients for treatment of oesophagogastric cancers rests on accurate staging. Laparoscopy has become a safe and effective staging tool in upper gastrointestinal cancers because of its ability to detect small peritoneal and liver metastases missed by imaging techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of staging laparoscopy (SL) in determining resectability of oesophagogastric cancers. METHODS: A review of 511 patients with oesophagogastric cancers referred to our centre during a 7-year period was performed. Four hundred and sixteen of them assessed to have resectable tumours after preoperative staging with CT and/or ultrasound underwent SL. The main outcome measure was the number of patients in whom laparoscopy changed treatment decision. RESULTS: Staging laparoscopy changed treatment decision in 84 cases (20.2\%): locally advanced disease in 17, extensive lymph node disease in four and distant metastases (liver and peritoneum) in 63 cases. The sensitivity of laparoscopy for resectability was 88\%. Eighty-one percent of patients who had combined CT scan and EUS were resectable at surgery compared with 65\% of those who had CT scan alone (statistically significant with P-value{$<$}0.05). Of those patients deemed resectable by SL 8.1\% were found to be unresectable at laparotomy, 16 with locally advanced disease and 11 with metastases. CONCLUSION: Staging laparoscopy avoided unnecessary laparotomy in 20.2\% of our patients and was most useful in adenocarcinoma, distal oesophageal, GOJ and gastric cancers and probably not necessary in lesions of the upper two-third of the oesophagus.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the analgesic efficacy and side effects of paravertebral and epidural blockade for thoracotomy was published in 2006. Nine well-designed randomized trials with controversial results have been published since then. The present report constitutes an updated meta-analysis of this issue. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND: Thoracotomy is a major surgical procedure and is associated with severe postoperative pain. Epidural analgesia is the gold standard for post-thoracotomy pain management, but has its limitations and contraindications, and paravertebral blockade is increasingly popular. However, it has not been decided whether the analgesic effect of the two methods is comparable, or whether paravertebral blockade leads to a lower incidence of adverse side effects after thoracotomy. METHODS: Two reviewers independently searched the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (last performed on 1 February, 2013) for reports of studies comparing post-thoracotomy epidural analgesia and paravertebral blockade. The same individuals independently extracted data from the appropriate studies. RESULT: Eighteen trials involving 777 patients were included in the current analysis. There was no significant difference in pain scores between paravertebral blockade and epidural analgesia at 4-8, 24, 48 hours, and the rates of pulmonary complications and morphine usage during the first 24 hours were also similar. However, paravertebral blockade was better than epidural analgesia in reducing the incidence of urinary retention (p{$<$}0.0001), nausea and vomiting (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01), hypotension (p{$<$}0.00001), and rates of failed block were lower in the paravertebral blockade group (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that PVB can provide comparable pain relief to traditional EPI, and may have a better side-effect profile for pain relief after thoracic surgery. Further high-powered randomized trials are to need to determine whether PVB truly offers any advantages over EPI.},

We reviewed a retrospective cohort of 27 patients treated at a single institution between 1999 and 2011. Clinical staging was performed with computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and endoscopic ultrasound. Patients were separated into two groups: neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery (NEOSURG) and surgery alone (SURG). There were 11 patients (41\%) in the NEOSURG group and 16 patients (59\%) in the SURG group. In the NEOSURG group, three of 11 patients (27\%) had a pathological complete response and eight (73\%) were partial or nonresponders after neoadjuvant therapy. In the SURG group, nine of 16 patients (56\%) were understaged, 6 (38\%) were overstaged, and 1 (6\%) was correctly staged. In the entire cohort, despite being clinically node negative, 14 of 27 patients (52\%) had node-positive disease (5/11 [45\%] in the NEOSURG group, and 9/16 [56\%] in the SURG group). Overall survival rate was not statistically significant between the two groups (P = 0.96). Many cT2N0 patients are clinically understaged and show no preoperative evidence of node-positive disease. Consequently, neoadjuvant therapy may have a beneficial role in treatment.},

METHODS: All patients in the current study were treated with trimodality therapy for nonmetastatic esophageal cancer from 1995 to 2009. Locoregional failure included lymph node failure (NF), anastomotic failure, or both. Abdominal paraaortic failure (PAF) was defined as disease recurrence at or below the superior mesenteric artery. RESULTS: Among 155 patients, the primary tumor location was the upper/middle esophagus in 18\%, the lower esophagus in 32\%, and the gastroesophageal junction in 50\% (adenocarcinoma in 79\% and squamous cell carcinoma in 21\%) of patients. Staging methods included endoscopic ultrasound (73\%), computed tomography (46\%), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (54\%). Approximately 40\% of patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II disease and 60\% had stage III disease. The median follow-up was 1.3 years. The 2-year locoregional control, event-free survival, and overall survival rates were 86\%, 36\%, and 48\%, respectively. The 2-year NF rate was 14\%, the isolated NF rate was 3\%, and the anastomotic failure rate was 6\%. The 2-year PAF rate was 9\% and the isolated PAF rate was 5\%. PAF was found to be increased among patients with gastroesophageal junction tumors (12\% vs 6\%), especially for the subset with {$\geq$} 2 clinically involved lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis (19\% vs 4\%). CONCLUSIONS: Few patients experience isolated NF or PAF as their first disease recurrence. Therefore, it is unlikely that targeting additional regional lymph node basins with radiotherapy would significantly improve clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {Introduction There is a known correlation between anaerobic threshold (AT) during cardiopulmonary exercise testing and development of cardiopulmonary complications in high-risk patients undergoing oesophagogastric cancer surgery. This study aimed to assess the value of routine retesting following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Methods Patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with subsequent oesophagogastric cancer surgery with pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy cardiopulmonary exercise data were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Measured cardiopulmonary exercise variables included AT and maximum oxygen uptake at peak exercise (VO2 peak). Anaerobic threshold values within 1 ml/kg/minute were considered static. Patients were grouped into AT ranges of less than 9 ml/kg/minute, 9-11 ml/kg/minute and greater than 11 ml/kg/minute. Outcome measures were unplanned intensive care stay, postoperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results Between May 2008 and August 2017, 42 patients from 675 total resections were identified, with a mean age of 65 years (range 49-84 years). Mean pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy AT was 11.07 ml/kg/minute (standard deviation, SD, 3.24 ml/kg/minute, range 4.6-19.3 ml/kg/minute) while post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy AT was 11.19 ml/kg/minute (SD 3.05 ml/kg/minute, range 5.2-18.1 ml/kg/minute). Mean pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy VO2 peak was 17.13 ml/kg/minute, while post-chemotherapy this mean fell to 16.59 ml/kg/minute. Some 44.4\% of patients with a pre-chemotherapy AT less than 9 ml/kg/minute developed cardiorespiratory complications compared with 42.2\% of those whose AT was greater than 9 ml/kg/minute (P = 0.914); 63.6\% of patients in the post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy group with an AT less than 9 ml/kg/minute developed cardiorespiratory complications. There was no correlation between direction of change in AT and outcome. Conclusion In our patient population, neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to result in a significant mean reduction in cardiorespiratory fitness. Routine pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy cardiopulmonary exercise testing is currently not indicated; however, larger studies are required to demonstrate this conclusively.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic eradication therapy is used to treat mucosal neoplasms in Barrett's esophagus, but cannot cure cancers that have metastasized to lymph nodes. The risk of such metastases has been proposed as a reason to consider esophagectomy rather than endoscopic therapy for esophageal mucosal neoplasia. The objective of our study was to determine the frequency of lymph-node metastases in patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using the PRISMA guidelines to identify studies that included patients who had esophagectomy for HGD or intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus, and that reported final pathology results after examination of esophagectomy specimens. RESULTS: We identified 70 relevant reports that included 1,874 patients who had esophagectomy performed for HGD or intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Lymph-node metastases were found in 26 patients (1.39 \% , 95 \% CI 0.86 \textendash{} 1.92). No metastases were found in the 524 patients who had a final pathology diagnosis of HGD, whereas 26 (1.93 \% , 95 \% CI 1.19 \textendash{} 2.66 \%) of the 1,350 patients with a final pathology diagnosis of intramucosal carcinoma had positive lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of unexpected lymph-node metastases for patients with mucosal neoplasms in Barrett's esophagus is in the range of 1 \textendash{} 2 \%. Esophagectomy has a mortality rate that often exceeds 2 \%, with substantial morbidity and no guarantee of curing metastatic disease. Therefore, the risk of lymph node metastases alone does not warrant the choice of esophagectomy over endoscopic therapy for HGD and intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Black patients with esophageal cancer have worse survival than white patients. This study examines this racial disparity in conjunction with socioeconomic status (SES) and explores whether race-based outcome differences exist using a national database. METHODS: The associations between race and SES with overall survival of patients treated with esophagectomy for stages I to III esophageal cancer between 2003 and 2011 in the National Cancer Data Base were investigated using the Kaplan-Meier method and proportional hazards analyses. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. RESULTS: Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2\%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5\%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5\%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p {$<$} 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p~{$<$} 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. CONCLUSIONS: Prior studies have suggested that survival of esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy is associated with race. Our study suggests that race is not significantly related to overall survival when adjusted for other prognostic variables. Socioeconomic status, however, remains significantly related to overall survival in our model.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the impact of age and comorbidity on choice and outcome of definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery. METHODS: In this population-based study, all patients with potentially curable EC (cT1N+/cT2-3, TX, any cN, cM0) diagnosed in the South East of the Netherlands between 2004 and 2014 were included. Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used to compare overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 702 patients was included. Age {$\geq$}\,75~years and multiple comorbidities were associated with a higher probability for dCRT (odds ratio [OR] 8.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 4.72-15.58; and OR 3.09; 95\% CI 1.93-4.93). The strongest associations were found for the combination of hypertension plus diabetes (OR 3.80; 95\% CI 1.97-7.32) and the combination of cardiovascular with pulmonary comorbidity (OR 3.18; 95\% CI 1.57-6.46). Patients with EC who underwent dCRT had a poorer prognosis than those who underwent nCRT plus surgery, irrespective of age, number, and type of comorbidities. In contrast, for patients with squamous cell carcinoma with {$\geq$}\,2 comorbidities or age {$\geq$}\,75~years, OS was comparable between both groups (hazard ratio [HR] 1.52; 95\% CI 0.78-2.97; and HR 0.73; 95\% CI 0.13-4.14). CONCLUSIONS: Histological tumor type should be acknowledged in treatment choices for patients with esophageal cancer. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery should basically be advised as treatment of choice for operable esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. For patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with {$\geq$}\,2 comorbidities or age {$\geq$}\,75~years, dCRT may be the preferred strategy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older patients are often considered high-risk surgical candidates for locally advanced esophageal cancer, and the benefit of surgery in this population is unclear. This national analysis examines the effect of age on esophagectomy outcomes and compares surgery versus chemoradiation in older patients. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients with clinical stage II to III esophageal adenocarcinoma undergoing surgery or definitive chemoradiation between 2004 and 2015. Restricted cubic splines were used to examine the relationship between age and survival after esophagectomy, and maximally selected rank statistics were used to identify an age at which survival worsened. We used Cox proportional hazard models including an interaction term between age and treatment to compare overall survival, as well as survival of patients receiving esophagectomy versus definitive chemoradiation. RESULTS: Of 17,495 patients, 11,680 underwent esophagectomy and 5815 received chemoradiation. Survival after esophagectomy worsened with increasing age and decreased considerably after age 73 (hazard ratio~= 1.05, 95\% confidence interval, 1.04-1.06, per increasing year after 73 versus hazard ratio~= 1.01, 95\% confidence interval, 1.00-1.01, per increasing year to 73; both P {$<$} .001). Chemoradiation was increasingly used over surgery as age increased. The interaction between age and treatment was significant, and a graph of this interaction demonstrated a survival benefit for surgery over chemoradiation at most ages, including octogenarians. CONCLUSIONS: Survival worsens with age after esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal cancer. However, esophagectomy is associated with improved survival compared with definitive chemoradiation at most ages, including octogenarians. Esophagectomy may be considered over chemoradiation for patients who can tolerate surgery regardless of age.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current information about outcomes in octogenarians undergoing cancer operations is limited largely to case series from selected centers. Population-based data can provide more realistic estimates of the risks and benefits of operations in this group. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing major resections for lung, esophageal, and pancreas cancer. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1994 to 2003), we examined operative mortality and discharge disposition in octogenarians (aged 80+ years), relative to younger patients (aged 65 to 69 years) (n = 272,662). We then used the Surveillance and End Results-Medicare-linked database (1992 to 2001) to measure late survival in the elderly (n = 14,088). RESULTS: Operative mortality among octogenarians was substantially higher than that of younger patients (aged 65 to 69 years) for all three cancers (esophagectomy, 19.9\% versus 8.8\%, p {$<$} 0.0001; pancreatectomy, 15.5\% versus 6.7\%, p {$<$} 0.0001; lung resection, 6.9\% versus 3.7\%, p {$<$} 0.0001). A large proportion of octogenarians were transferred to extended care facilities after operation, ranging from 24\% after lung resection to 44\% after esophagectomy. Five-year survival in octogenarians was low for all three cancers: 11\% after pancreatectomy, 18\% after esophagectomy and 31\% after lung cancer resection. Survival among octogenarians with two or more comorbidities was worse than those with fewer comorbid diagnoses--10\% versus 14\% for pancreatectomy, 15\% versus 23\% for esophagectomy, and 27\% versus 37\% for lung resection. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based outcomes after high-risk cancer operation in octogenarians are considerably worse than typically reported in case series and published survival statistics. Such information might better inform clinical decision making in this high-risk group.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with carcinomas of the esophagus (n = 43) or gastroesophageal junction (n = 31) were studied. All patients underwent attenuation-corrected FDG-PET imaging, a spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, and an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). RESULTS: FDG-PET demonstrated increased activity in the primary tumor in 70 of 74 patients (sensitivity: 95\%). False-negative PET images were found in four patients with T1 lesions. Thirty-four patients (46\%) had stage IV disease. FDG-PET had a higher accuracy for diagnosing stage IV disease compared with the combination of CT and EUS (82\% v 64\%, respectively; P: =.004). FDG-PET had additional diagnostic value in 16 (22\%) of 74 patients by upstaging 11 (15\%) and downstaging five (7\%) patients. Thirty-nine (53\%) of the 74 patients underwent a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy in conjunction with primary curative esophagectomy. In these patients, tumoral involvement was found in 21 local and 35 regional or distant lymph nodes (LN). For local LN, the sensitivity of FDG-PET was lower than EUS (33\% v 81\%, respectively; P: =.027), but the specificity may have been higher (89\% v 67\%, respectively; P: = not significant [NS]). For the assessment of regional and distant LN involvement, compared with the combined use of CT and EUS, FDG-PET had a higher specificity (90\% v 98\%, respectively; P: =. 025) and a similar sensitivity (46\% v 43\%, respectively; P: = NS). CONCLUSION: PET significantly improves the detection of stage IV disease in EC compared with the conventional staging modalities. PET improves diagnostic specificity for LN staging.},

METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, two cohorts of patients with EC were created: (I) patients who received RT with their initial therapy; and (II) those who did not. Heart disease specific survival (HDSS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional-hazards regression methods were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: We identified 40,778 patients with EC. A total of 26,377 patients received RT and 14,401 did not. HDSS analysis revealed increased risk of HDRD in those receiving RT (P{$<$}0.05), with an absolute risk of HDRD of 2.8\%, 5.3\% and 9.4\% at 5-, 10- and 20-year, respectively. Log rank test of HDSS revealed the risk of HDRD became significant at 8 months (P{$<$}0.05). The following were associated with HDRD: RT, age, race, stage at presentation, time period of diagnosis, and known comorbid condition keeping one from esophagectomy. On multivariate analysis, RT remained predictive of HDRD [hazard ratio (HR) 1.46, P{$<$}0.05]. When considering only candidates for definitive therapy, RT remained predictive of HDRD on univariate (HR 1.53, P{$<$}0.0001) and multivariate (HR 1.62, P{$<$}0.0001) analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The use of RT leads to increased risk of HDRD that is detectable as early as eight months from diagnosis. More research is needed to define optimal dose volume parameters to prevent cardiac death. Consideration should be given to this risk in relation to prognosis and the expected benefits of RT.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lung-protective ventilation with the use of low tidal volumes and positive end-expiratory pressure is considered best practice in the care of many critically ill patients. However, its role in anesthetized patients undergoing major surgery is not known. METHODS: In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group trial, we randomly assigned 400 adults at intermediate to high risk of pulmonary complications after major abdominal surgery to either nonprotective mechanical ventilation or a strategy of lung-protective ventilation. The primary outcome was a composite of major pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications occurring within the first 7 days after surgery. RESULTS: The two intervention groups had similar characteristics at baseline. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome occurred in 21 of 200 patients (10.5\%) assigned to lung-protective ventilation, as compared with 55 of 200 (27.5\%) assigned to nonprotective ventilation (relative risk, 0.40; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 0.68; P=0.001). Over the 7-day postoperative period, 10 patients (5.0\%) assigned to lung-protective ventilation required noninvasive ventilation or intubation for acute respiratory failure, as compared with 34 (17.0\%) assigned to nonprotective ventilation (relative risk, 0.29; 95\% CI, 0.14 to 0.61; P=0.001). The length of the hospital stay was shorter among patients receiving lung-protective ventilation than among those receiving nonprotective ventilation (mean difference, -2.45 days; 95\% CI, -4.17 to -0.72; P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: As compared with a practice of nonprotective mechanical ventilation, the use of a lung-protective ventilation strategy in intermediate-risk and high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery was associated with improved clinical outcomes and reduced health care utilization.

  abstract = {Reduced physical functioning is common following resections for esophageal cancer; however, objective data on physical performance outcomes in this cohort are rare. The aim of this study was to assess the physical performance and health related quality of life (HRQOL) of disease free survivors and compare findings in a case matched noncancer control group. Twenty-five males (mean ({$\pm$}SD) aged 63 ({$\pm$}6) years) who were over 6 months postesophagectomy and disease-free were compared with 25 controls (60 {$\pm$} 6 years). Physical functioning was assessed through hand grip strength (dynamometry), exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk test), physical activity levels (RT3 accelerometer), and body composition (bio-electrical impedance analysis). Health-related quality of life was measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Esophageal cancer survivors demonstrated significantly lower fitness (P {$<$} 0.001) and time spent in moderate (P {$<$} 0.001) and vigorous (P {$<$} 0.001) intensity physical activity compared with controls. Global health status and quality of life were similar in both groups (P = 0.245); however, physical and role functioning domains were lower in the cancer survivors (P {$<$} 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively). These data show that disease-free survivors of curative esophageal cancer treatment demonstrate a significant compromise in physical functioning compared with controls, thus highlighting the multiple, complex rehabilitative needs of this cohort.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic circumferential balloon-based ablation by using radiofrequency energy for treating BE HGD. DESIGN: Multicenter U.S. registry. SETTING: Sixteen academic and community centers; treatment period from September 2004 to March 2007. PATIENTS: Patients with histologic evidence of intestinal metaplasia (IM) that contained HGD confirmed by at least 2 expert pathologists. A prior EMR was permitted, provided that residual HGD remained in the BE region for ablation. INTERVENTION: Endoscopic circumferential ablation with follow-up esophageal biopsies to assess the histologic response to treatment. OUTCOMES: Histologic complete response (CR) end points: (1) all biopsy specimen fragments obtained at the last biopsy session were negative for HGD (CR-HGD), (2) all biopsy specimens were negative for any dysplasia (CR-D), and (3) all biopsy specimens were negative for IM (CR-IM). RESULTS: A total of 142 patients (median age 66 years, interquartile range [IQR] 59-75 years) who had BE HGD (median length 6 cm, IQR 3-8 cm) underwent circumferential ablation (median 1 session, IQR 1-2). No serious adverse events were reported. There was 1 asymptomatic stricture and no buried glands. Ninety-two patients had at least 1 follow-up biopsy session (median follow-up 12 months, IQR 8-15 months). A CR-HGD was achieved in 90.2\% of patients, CR-D in 80.4\%, and CR-IM in 54.3\%. LIMITATIONS: A nonrandomized study design, without a control arm, a lack of centralized pathology review, ablation and biopsy technique not standardized, and a relatively short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic circumferential ablation is a promising modality for the treatment of BE that contains HGD. In this multicenter registry, the intervention safely achieved a CR for HGD in 90.2\% of patients at a median of 12 months of follow-up.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Radiation therapy (RT) for esophageal cancer often results in unintended radiation doses delivered to the heart owing to anatomic proximity. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we examined late cardiac death in survivors of esophageal cancer that had or had not received RT. METHODS: 5,630 patients were identified that were diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma (AC) from 1973-2012, who were followed for at least 5 years after therapy. Examined risk factors for cardiac death included age ({$\leq$}55/56-65/66-75/{$>$}75), gender, race (white/non-white), stage (local/regional/distant), histology (SCC/AC), esophageal location ({$<$}18cm/18-24cm/25-32cm/33-40cm from incisors), diagnosis year (1973-1992/1993-2002/2003-2012), and receipt of surgery and/or RT. Time to cardiac death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox model was used to evaluate risk factors for cardiac death in propensity score matched data. RESULTS: Patients who received RT were younger, diagnosed more recently, had more advanced disease, SCC histology, and no surgery. The RT group had higher risk of cardiac death than the no-RT group (log-rank p{$<$}0.0001). The median time to cardiac death in the RT group was 289 months (95\% CI, 255-367) and was not reached in the no-RT group. The probability of cardiac death increased with age and decreased with diagnosis year, and this trend was more pronounced in the RT group. Multivariate analysis found RT to be associated with higher probability of cardiac death (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.03-1.47, HR 1.961, 95\% CI 1.466-2.624). Lower esophageal subsite (33-40 cm) was also associated with a higher risk of cardiac death. Other variables were not associated with cardiac death. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing the limitations of a SEER analysis including lack of comorbidity accountability, these data should prompt more definitive study as to whether a possible associative effect of RT on cardiac death could potentially be a causative effect.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The preoperative period (prehabilitation) may represent a more appropriate time than the postoperative period to implement an intervention. The impact of prehabilitation on recovery of function al exercise capacity was thus studied in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer. METHODS: A parallel-arm single-blind superiority randomized controlled trial was conducted. Seventy-seven patients were randomized to receive either prehabilitation (n = 38) or rehabilitation (n = 39). Both groups received a home-based intervention of moderate aerobic and resistance exercises, nutritional counseling with protein supplementation, and relaxation exercises initiated either 4 weeks before surgery (prehabilitation) or immediately after surgery (rehabilitation), and continued for 8 weeks after surgery. Patients were managed with an enhanced recovery pathway. Primary outcome was functional exercise capacity measured using the validated 6-min walk test. RESULTS: Median duration of prehabilitation was 24.5 days. While awaiting surgery, functional walking capacity increased ({$\geq$} 20 m) in a higher proportion of the prehabilitation group compared with the rehabilitation group (53 vs. 15\%, adjusted P = 0.006). Complication rates and duration of hospital stay were similar. The difference between baseline and 8-week 6-min walking test was significantly higher in the prehabilitation compared with the rehabilitation group (+23.7 m [SD, 54.8] vs. -21.8 m [SD, 80.7]; mean difference 45.4 m [95\% CI, 13.9 to 77.0]). A higher proportion of the prehabilitation group were also recovered to or above baseline exercise capacity at 8 weeks compared with the rehabilitation group (84 vs. 62\%, adjusted P = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Meaningful changes in postoperative functional exercise capacity can be achieved with a prehabilitation program.},

METHODS: We developed recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in nonorthopedic surgical patients by using systematic methods as described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines. Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement. RESULTS: We describe several alternatives for stratifying the risk of VTE in general and abdominal-pelvic surgical patients. When the risk for VTE is very low ({$<$} 0.5\%), we recommend that no specific pharmacologic (Grade 1B) or mechanical (Grade 2C) prophylaxis be used other than early ambulation. For patients at low risk for VTE ({$\sim$}1.5\%), we suggest mechanical prophylaxis, preferably with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), over no prophylaxis (Grade 2C). For patients at moderate risk for VTE ({$\sim$}3\%) who are not at high risk for major bleeding complications, we suggest low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (Grade 2B), low-dose unfractionated heparin (Grade 2B), or mechanical prophylaxis with IPC (Grade 2C) over no prophylaxis. For patients at high risk for VTE ({$\sim$}6\%) who are not at high risk for major bleeding complications, we recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH (Grade 1B) or low-dose unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) over no prophylaxis. In these patients, we suggest adding mechanical prophylaxis with elastic stockings or IPC to pharmacologic prophylaxis (Grade 2C). For patients at high risk for VTE undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer, we recommend extended-duration, postoperative, pharmacologic prophylaxis (4 weeks) with LMWH over limited-duration prophylaxis (Grade 1B). For patients at moderate to high risk for VTE who are at high risk for major bleeding complications or those in whom the consequences of bleeding are believed to be particularly severe, we suggest use of mechanical prophylaxis, preferably with IPC, over no prophylaxis until the risk of bleeding diminishes and pharmacologic prophylaxis may be initiated (Grade 2C). For patients in all risk groups, we suggest that an inferior vena cava filter not be used for primary VTE prevention (Grade 2C) and that surveillance with venous compression ultrasonography should not be performed (Grade 2C). We developed similar recommendations for other nonorthopedic surgical populations. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal thromboprophylaxis in nonorthopedic surgical patients will consider the risks of VTE and bleeding complications as well as the values and preferences of individual patients.},

METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study using the National Cancer Data Base to evaluate patients with newly diagnosed metastatic esophageal cancer between 2004 and 2012. Overall survival outcomes after treatment with chemotherapy plus conventional palliative dose radiotherapy ({$<$}5040 cGy), chemotherapy plus definitive dose radiotherapy ({$\geq$}5040 cGy), or chemotherapy alone were compared by using Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. Potential unmeasured confounding was assessed through sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 12,683 patients: 57\% were treated with chemotherapy alone, 24\% were treated with chemotherapy plus palliative dose radiotherapy, and 19\% were treated with chemotherapy plus definitive dose radiotherapy. Compared with chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy plus definitive dose radiotherapy was associated with improved survival (median overall survival of 8.3 versus 11.3 months [hazard ratio~= 0.72, 95\% confidence interval: 0.70-0.74, p {$\leq$} 0.001]), whereas chemotherapy plus palliative dose radiotherapy was associated with slightly inferior outcomes (median overall survival of 8.3 months versus 7.5 months (hazard ratio~= 1.10, 95\% confidence interval 1.07-1.13, p {$\leq$} 0.001). These findings were robust to potential unmeasured confounding in sensitivity analyses. Additionally, landmark analyses confirmed these findings in patients surviving 12 months or longer. CONCLUSIONS: Definitive dose, but not conventional palliative dose, PTDRT is associated with improved overall survival in metastatic esophageal cancer, suggesting that local control may be important to prognosis. These findings support integrating PTDRT into future clinical trials aimed at refining personalized treatment for patients with metastatic esophageal cancer.},

We analyzed data from a UK registry that follows the outcomes of patients with BE who have undergone RFA for neoplasia. METHODS: We collected data on 335 patients with BE and neoplasia (72\% with HGD, 24\% with intramucosal cancer, 4\% with low-grade dysplasia [mean age, 69 years; 81\% male]), treated at 19 centers in the United Kingdom from July 2008 through August 2012. Mean length of BE segments was 5.8 cm (range, 1-20 cm). Patients' nodules were removed by endoscopic mucosal resection, and the patients then underwent RFA every 3 months until all areas of BE were ablated or cancer developed. Biopsies were collected 12 months after the first RFA; clearance of HGD, dysplasia, and BE were assessed. RESULTS: HGD was cleared from 86\% of patients, all dysplasia from 81\%, and BE from 62\% at the 12-month time point, after a mean of 2.5 (range, 2-6) RFA procedures. Complete reversal dysplasia was 15\% less likely for every 1-cm increment in BE length (odds ratio~= 1.156; SE~= 0.048; 95\% confidence interval: 1.07-1.26; P {$<$} .001). Endoscopic mucosal resection before RFA did not provide any benefit. Invasive cancer developed in 10 patients (3\%) by the 12-month time point and disease had progressed in 17 patients (5.1\%) after a median follow-up time of 19 months. Symptomatic strictures developed in 9\% of patients and were treated by endoscopic dilatation. Nineteen months after therapy began, 94\% of patients remained clear of dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed data from a large series of patients in the United Kingdom who underwent RFA for BE-related neoplasia and found that by 12 months after treatment, dysplasia was cleared from 81\%.

  abstract = {Recently, depletion of skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia) has been linked to poor prognosis in several types of cancers, but has not been investigated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This retrospective study investigates the relationship between sarcopenia and clinical outcome in ESCC patients treated by surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation therapy (dCRT). The study was retrospectively conducted in a single academic hospital in Kumamoto, Japan, and involved 325 ESCC patients (256 surgical cases and 69 dCRT cases) treated between April 2005 and April 2011. Skeletal muscle mass was quantified by radiologic measures using standard computed tomography scans. The skeletal muscle tissue in the 325 ESCC patients was distributed as follows: mean: 47.10; median: 46.88; standard deviation (SD): 7.39; range: 31.48\textendash 71.11; interquartile range, 46.29\textendash 47.90. Skeletal muscle tissue was greater in male patients than in female patients (P {$<$} 0.0001), but was independent of other clinical and tumor features. Sarcopenia was not significantly associated with overall survival (log rank P = 0.54). Lymph node involvement significantly altered the relationship between sarcopenia and survival rate (P for interaction = 0.026). Sarcopenia significantly reduced the overall survival of patients without lymph node involvement (log rank P = 0.035), but was uncorrelated with overall survival in patients with lymph involvement (log rank, P = 0.31). The anastomosis leakage rate was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group than in the non-sarcopenia group (P = 0.032), but other surgical complications did not significantly differ between the two groups. Sarcopenia in ESCC patients without lymph node involvement is associated with poor prognosis, indicating sarcopenia as a potential biomarker for identifying patients likely to experience an inferior outcome. Moreover, sarcopenia was associated with anastomosis leakage but no other short-term surgical outcome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Management of clinical T2N0M0 (cT2N0M0) esophageal cancer remains controversial. We reviewed our institutional experience over 21~years (1990-2011) to determine clinical staging accuracy, optimal treatment approaches, and factors predictive of survival in this patient population. METHODS: Patients with cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer determined by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) were identified through a prospectively collected database. Demographics, perioperative data, and outcomes were examined. Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier plots were used for statistical survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 731 patients underwent esophagectomy, of whom 68 cT2N0M0 patients (9~\%) were identified. Fifty-seven patients (84~\%) had adenocarcinoma. Thirty-three patients (48.5~\%) were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery, and 35 underwent surgical resection alone. All resections except one included a transthoracic approach with two-field lymph node dissection. Thirty-day operative mortality was 2.9~\%. Only 3 patients (8.5~\%) who underwent surgery alone had T2N0M0 disease identified by pathology: the disease of 15 (42.8~\%) was found to be overstaged and 17 (48.5~\%) understaged after surgery. Understaging was more common in poorly differentiated tumors (p~=~0.03). Nine patients (27.2~\%) had complete pathologic response after chemoradiotherapy. Absence of lymph node metastases (pN0) was significantly more frequent in the neoadjuvant group (29 of 33 vs. 21 of 35, p~=~0.01). Median follow-up was 44.2~months. Overall 5-year survival was 50.8~\%. On multivariate analysis, adenocarcinoma (p~=~0.001) and pN0 after resection (p~=~0.01) were significant predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: EUS was inaccurate in staging cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer in this study. Poorly differentiated tumors were more frequently understaged. Adenocarcinoma and absence of lymph node metastases (pN0) were independently predictive of long-term survival. pN0 status was significantly more common in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, but long-term survival was not affected by neoadjuvant therapy. A strategy of neoadjuvant therapy followed by resection may be optimal in this group, especially in patients with disease likely to be understaged.},

Chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (trimodality therapy) has not been widely adopted. The outcomes of patients undergoing dCRT or trimodality therapy at our cancer center between 2004 and 2012 were restrospectively analyzed. Trimodality therapy was offered to selected patients of good performance status (World Health Organisation performance status 0/1), with squamous cell carcinoma or bulky adenocarcinoma. dCRT was offered to patients of good PS but with comorbidities, upper third tumors or at patient's request. Patients received four cycles of chemotherapy with a platinum agent (mostly cisplatin) and a fluoropyrimidine (mostly 5-fluorouracil) over a total of 11 weeks. Cycles 3 and 4 were given concurrently with radiotherapy: 50 Gy in 25 fractions for dCRT and 45 Gy in 25 fractions in the trimodality group. Surgery occurred 8-10 weeks following the completion of chemoradiotherapy. The cut-off length for maximum gross tumor volume length was 10 cm. One hundred two patients were included (47 received dCRT, and 55 received trimodality treatment). The majority of tumors were stage III (80.4\%), and two-thirds were located in the distal esophagus (64.7\%). Median follow-up was 44 months. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 57.3\% (median OS 39.7 months) for the dCRT group and 77.8\% (median not reached) for the trimodality group. The 5-year OS rates were 38\% and 58\%, respectively. Postoperative mortality rate was low at 1.8\%, and the pathological complete response rate was 23.6\%. In conclusion, trimodality treatment for patients with esophageal and junctional gastroesophageal tumors offers high rates of 2-year survival, and the potential for long-term cure. dCRT is an established alternative for patients that are not fit or suitable for surgery.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study is to assess CT-PET and endoscopic assessment postneoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in predicting complete pathologic response (pCR) in locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC). Design: A prospective cohort study. Background: nCRT is increasingly standard of care in LAEC, with pCR a surrogate for excellent outcome. Predicting pCR before surgery, with metabolic imaging and endoscopy, may spare patients' operative intervention. Methods: One hundred thirty-eight consecutive patients [mean age 61 \AE{} 8, 99 male (72\%), 103 (75\%) adenocarcinoma] underwent nCRT with CT-PET and endoscopy 4 to 6 weeks later, and surgery subsequently. A complete metabolic response (cMR) was defined as SUVmax of {$<$}4. A complete endoscopic response (cER) was no residual mucosal abnormality. The association of pCR with cMR and cER was analyzed. Results: pCR was achieved in 30 patients (22\%); 37\% SCC and 17\% adenocarcinoma. A cMR was evident in 63 (46\%), of whom 17 (27\%) had a pCR and 17(27\%) were ypN\th. A cER was observed in 45 (33\%). The Spearman correlation for cER and cMR was 0.066 (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.479), for cER and pCR was 0.004 (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.969), and cMR and pCR \textendash 0.120 (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.160). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of cMR was 57\%, 57\%, 27\%, and 82\%, respectively, and for combined cMR and cER was 24\%, 83\%, 28\%, and 79\%, respectively. Conclusions: The prediction of pCR through CT-PET and endoscopy independently or combined is limited by low sensitivity and poor positive predictive value. Protocols to avoid surgery in patients with apparent complete clinical complete based on these criteria should be adopted with considerable caution.},

METHODS: Tumor lengths were examined retrospectively for 389 esophagectomy patients with respect to Endoscopy, EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound), CT and PET-CT, and pathology. Correlations between the measurements on the different approaches were assessed, and associations between tumor length and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Only the tumor lengths assessed on pathology were found to be significantly associated with overall (P\,=\,0.001) and recurrence free (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) survival on univariable analysis. The median overall survival was 47.1 months in those patients with tumor lengths {$<$}3.0\,cm, falling to 19.6 and 18.0 months in those with 3.0-4.4 and 4.5+\,cm tumors, respectively, demonstrating a reduction in patient survival at a tumor length of around 3\,cm. Tumor length on pathology was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation and both T- and N-categories. After accounting for these factors, tumor length on pathology was a significant independent predictor of recurrence-free (P\,=\,0.016), but not overall (P\,=\,0.128) survival. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor lengths on pathology were found to be the most predictive of patient outcome. However, after accounting for other tumor-related factors, tumor length only resulted in a marginal improvement in predictive accuracy.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical outcomes in patients with resectable thoracic EC with SCLN metastases (M1LYM) treated by esophagectomy or definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were divided in three groups: Surgery with perioperative therapy, n=45; surgery alone, n=19; and dCRT, n=38. Overall, median progression-free survival and median survival time were 9.3 and 26.7 months, respectively. The median survival time was 27.5 months in the group treated with surgery with perioperative treatment, 50.6 months in those treated with surgery alone, and 22 months in the dCRT group. No significant survival difference was seen among the three groups. CONCLUSION: Over 30\% of patients with resectable M1LYM treated with curative intent achieved long-term survival.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Post-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) FDG PET is a useful prognosticator of esophageal cancer. However, debate on the diverse criteria of previous publications preclude worldwide multicenter comparisons, and even a universal practice guide. We aimed to validate a simple qualitative interpretation criterion of post-CRT FDG PET for outcome stratification and compare it with other criteria. METHODS: The post-CRT FDG PET of 114 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were independently interpreted using a qualitative 4-point scale (Qual4PS) that identified focal esophageal FDG uptake greater than liver uptake as residual tumor. Cohen's {$\kappa$} coefficient ({$\kappa$}) was used to measure interobserver agreement of Qual4PS. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used for survival analysis. Other criteria included a different qualitative approach (QualBK), maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax3.4, SUVmax2.5), relative change of SUVmax between pre- and post-CRT FDG PET ({$\Delta$}SUVmax), mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean), metabolic volume (MV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). RESULTS: Overall interobserver agreement on the Qual4PS criterion was excellent ({$\kappa$}: 0.95). Except the QualBK, SUVmax2.5, and TLG, all the other criteria were significant predictors for overall survival (OS). Multivariable analysis showed only Qual4PS (HR: 15.41; P = 0.005) and AJCC stage (HR: 2.47; P = 0.007) were significant independent variables. The 2-year OS rates of Qual4PS(-) patients undergoing CRT alone (68.4\%) and patients undergoing trimodality therapy (62.5\%) were not significant different, but the 2-year OS rates of Qual4PS(+) patients undergoing CRT alone (10.0\%) were significantly lower than in patients undergoing trimodality therapy (42.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: The Qual4PS criterion is reproducible for assessing the response of ESCC to CRT, and valuable for predicting survival. It may add value to response-adapted treatment for ESCC patients, and help to decide whether surgery is warranted after CRT.},

METHODS: We randomly assigned 220 patients with adenocarcinoma of the mid-to-distal esophagus or adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia involving the distal esophagus either to transhiatal esophagectomy or to transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en bloc lymphadenectomy. Principal end points were overall survival and disease-free survival. Early morbidity and mortality, the number of quality-adjusted life-years gained, and cost effectiveness were also determined. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were assigned to undergo transhiatal esophagectomy, and 114 to undergo transthoracic esophagectomy. Demographic characteristics and characteristics of the tumor were similar in the two groups. Perioperative morbidity was higher after transthoracic esophagectomy, but there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (P=0.45). After a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 142 patients had died--74 (70 percent) after transhiatal resection and 68 (60 percent) after transthoracic resection (P=0.12). Although the difference in survival was not statistically significant, there was a trend toward a survival benefit with the extended approach at five years: disease-free survival was 27 percent in the transhiatal-esophagectomy group, as compared with 39 percent in the transthoracic-esophagectomy group (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -1 to 24 percent [the negative value indicates better survival with transhiatal resection]), whereas overall survival was 29 percent as compared with 39 percent (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -3 to 23 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Transhiatal esophagectomy was associated with lower morbidity than transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en bloc lymphadenectomy. Although median overall, disease-free, and quality-adjusted survival did not differ statistically between the groups, there was a trend toward improved long-term survival at five years with the extended transthoracic approach.},

The prognostic significance of MTV, SUVmax, and other clinicopathological variables was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. To further evaluate and compare the predictive performance of PET parameters, MTV and SUVmax, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used. RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, age, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) factors, MTV, and SUVmax of primary tumor were significant predictors of survival. On multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and treatment modality, independent predictive factors associated with decreased overall survival were T stage [hazard ratio (HR) 4.325, P = 0.006], M stage (HR 2.009, P = 0.007), and MTV (HR 1.013, P = 0.021). SUVmax was not a significant factor (HR 0.97, P = 0.061). On time-dependent ROC analysis, MTV showed good predictive performance for overall survival consistently better than SUVmax. CONCLUSION: MTV, a volumetric parameter of (18)F-FDG PET, is an important independent prognostic factor for survival and a better predictor of survival than SUVmax for the primary tumor in patients with esophageal carcinoma.},

  abstract = {Surgery for esophageal cancer is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Reduced pulmonary functions and exercise capacity are known as risk factors for complications after esophagectomy. The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a simple field test that can be used to evaluate the functional exercise capacity of patients who undergo thoracic surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the preoperative 6MWD with postoperative complications in patients with esophageal cancer. Records of a total of 111 patients who underwent thoracic surgery followed by postoperative rehabilitation from January 2013 to December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Data of patients who experienced Clavien-Dindo grade II or severer (grade~{$\geq~$}II) complications were compared with those who experienced grade~{$\leq$}I complications. The 6MWD was significantly correlated with age, serum albumin concentration, hemoglobin concentration, and hand grip strength. A total of 42 patients experienced grade~{$\geq$}II. The 6MWD of patients with grade~{$\geq~$}II complications was significantly shorter than that of those with grade~{$\leq$}I complications. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, 6MWD~{$\leq~$}454 m was a threshold for predicting grade~{$\geq$}II complications with 71.0\% sensitivity and 54.8\% specificity. The incidence of grade~{$\geq$}II complications led to delayed ambulation and longer stays in hospital. In the multiple regression analysis, the preoperative risk factors for incidence of grade~{$\geq$}II complications included lower levels of preoperative 6MWD and \% of the predicted value of forced expiratory volume in 1~second. Our results indicate that the 6MWT is useful to assess preoperative physical status in patients with esophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Though the surgical treatment of esophageal cancer is increasingly accepted for elderly people defined as aged over 70 years, less is reported about the results in patients over 75. This study is a single institution retrospective analysis of outcome after esophagectomy for cancer of the esophagus and GEJ in patients aged over 75 years. METHODS: All consecutive patients 76 years old and over undergoing curative esophagectomy for cancer in the period 1991-2006 were analyzed as to comorbidities, outcome and long-term survival. All the data had been prospectively collected in a database. Postoperative mortality risk was assessed by P-POSSUM and O-POSSUM score for in-hospital mortality and by the recently published Steyerberg's score system [Steyerberg EW, Neville BA, Koppert LB, Lemmens VEPP, Tilanus HW, Coebergh JWW, Weeks JC, Earle CC. Surgical mortality in patients with esophageal cancer: development and validation of a simple risk score. J Clin Oncol 2006;24:4277-84.] for 30-day mortality. Five-year survival was compared to the standardized survival in the general population. RESULTS: One hundred and eight patients fulfilling the abovementioned criteria were found (76 males and 32 females, mean age 79.5 years, mean standardized life-expectancy: 7.36 years). Among them, 69\% had esophageal tumors and 31\% GEJ tumors. The predominant histology was adenocarcinoma (74\%). Eighty-six (79.6\%) presented with one or more major comorbidities or a history of previous major upper-GI surgery, potentially affecting the surgical outcome. All underwent resection with curative intent (R(0) 83.3\%, R(1) 12\%, R(2) 4.6\%). The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 51.9\%, pulmonary complications (37\%) being the most frequent. Postoperative mortality, mainly due to cardiopulmonary complications, was 7.4\%, which was consistent with that predicted by P-POSSUM score (7.2\%) and lower than that predicted by O-POSSUM score (15.1\%). Thirty-day mortality was 5.5\%, being consistent with that predicted by the Steyerberg's score (6.8\%). Overall 5-year survival was 35.7\%, while R(0) overall survival 42\% and cancer specific R(0) survival 51.7\%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients 76 years old and over with esophageal or GEJ cancer should not be denied surgery solely on the basis of age. Outcome and long-term results in the selected elderly are not differing from those reported for younger patients. However, despite thorough preoperative assessment being applied in the selection of the candidates for surgery, a practical and reliable individual risk-analysis stratification is still lacking.},

Patients with more comorbidities or advanced age are more likely to be given definitive chemoradiation due to surgical risk. We aimed to identify subsets of patients in whom the addition of surgery to chemoradiation does not provide an overall survival (OS) benefit. The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received either definitive chemoradiation or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Bivariate analysis was used to assess the association between patient characteristics and treatment groups. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were performed to assess for differences in survival. A total of 15,090 with adenocarcinoma and 5,356 with squamous cell carcinoma met the inclusion criteria. Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery had significantly improved survival by Cox proportional hazards model regardless of histology if {$<$}50, 50-60, 61-70, or 71-80~years old. There was no significant benefit or detriment in patients 81-90~years old. Survival advantage was also significant with a Charlson/Deyo comorbidity condition score of 0, 1, 2, and {$\geq$}3 in adenocarcinoma squamous cell carcinoma with scores of 2 or {$\geq$}3 had no significant benefit or detriment. Patients 81-90~years old or with squamous cell carcinoma and a Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score\,{$\geq$}\,2 lacked an OS benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery compared with definitive chemoradiation. Careful consideration of esophagectomy-specific surgical risks should be used when recommending treatment for these patients.},

The results of these studies support the concept that, just as in many other solid malignancies, systemic spread may happen at an early stage in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer. Such systemic spread is often occult (micrometastases) at the time of primary diagnosis, which may have adverse effects on survival. Improved staging can be expected with information on micrometastases, and a subgroup of patients who will benefit most from adjuvant therapy might be identified. Although reliable and standard methods need to be developed before detection of micrometastasis is incorporated in the routine clinical practice, we suggest that it be considered an important correlate in clinical trials in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoracotomy induces severe postoperative pain and impairment of pulmonary function, and therefore regional analgesia has been intensively studied in this procedure. Thoracic epidural analgesia is commonly considered the "gold standard" in this setting; however, evaluation of the evidence is needed to assess the comparative benefits of alternative techniques, guide clinical practice and identify areas requiring further research. METHODS: In this systematic review of randomized trials we evaluated thoracic epidural, paravertebral, intrathecal, intercostal, and interpleural analgesic techniques, compared to each other and to systemic opioid analgesia, in adult thoracotomy. Postoperative pain, analgesic use, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Continuous paravertebral block was as effective as thoracic epidural analgesia with local anesthetic (LA) but was associated with a reduced incidence of hypotension. Paravertebral block reduced the incidence of pulmonary complications compared with systemic analgesia, whereas thoracic epidural analgesia did not. Thoracic epidural analgesia was superior to intrathecal and intercostal techniques, although these were superior to systemic analgesia; interpleural analgesia was inadequate. CONCLUSIONS: Either thoracic epidural analgesia with LA plus opioid or continuous paravertebral block with LA can be recommended. Where these techniques are not possible, or are contraindicated, intrathecal opioid or intercostal nerve block are recommended despite insufficient duration of analgesia, which requires the use of supplementary systemic analgesia. Quantitative meta-analyses were limited by heterogeneity in study design, and subject numbers were small. Further well designed studies are required to investigate the optimum components of the epidural solution and to rigorously evaluate the risks/benefits of continuous infusion paravertebral and intercostal techniques compared with thoracic epidural analgesia.},

We previously published a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 16-week trial on effects of once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, liraglutide on weight, satiation, and gastric functions in obese volunteers. The aim of this substudy is to compare to placebo the effects of liraglutide on appetite, taste preference, regional body fat stores, and anthropometric measurements. METHODS: Forty obese adults received standard instruction for weight management, monthly behavioral intervention utilizing motivational interviews, and 16-week treatment of once-daily liraglutide (escalated to 3 mg SQ daily). At baseline and 16 weeks, the following were measured: appetite and taste preferences rated every 30 min for 5 h after ingesting 300 mL Ensure\textregistered; maximal tolerated volume (MTV) with a nutrient drink test; fasting and postprandial bioactive GLP-1 (7-36) and peptide YY (PYY) levels; total and regional body fat with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and waist and hip circumference. RESULTS: Thirty-five participants (17 liraglutide; 18 placebo) completed the trial. Compared to placebo group, liraglutide group had significant reductions in MTV; prospective food consumption score; desire to eat something sweet, salty, savory or fatty; and an increase in perceived fullness. Postprandial plasma levels of GLP-1 decreased and PYY levels increased with liraglutide relative to baseline. Significant reductions in total body, trunk, and upper and lower body fat without reduction in lean body mass were observed. CONCLUSION: Liraglutide 3 mg SQ modulates appetite, taste preference, gut hormones, and regional body fat stores in adults with obesity without reduction in lean body mass.},

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: MIE provides lower postoperative morbidity and mortality, and similar short-term oncological quality compared to OE. METHODS: Data was acquired from the Dutch Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Audit. Patients undergoing minimally invasive or open, transthoracic or transhiatal esophagectomy for primary esophageal cancer between 2011-2015 were included. A propensity-score matching analysis for MIE versus OE was performed separately for transthoracic and transhiatal esophagectomies. RESULTS: A total of 1036 transthoracic MIE and OE patients, and 582 transhiatal MIE and OE patients were matched. Long-term survival was comparable for MIE and OE for both transthoracic and transhiatal procedures (5-year overall survival: transthoracic MIE 49.2\% vs. OE 51.1\%, p 0.695; transhiatal MIE 48.4\% vs. OE 50.7\%, p 0.832). For both procedures, MIE yielded more lymph nodes (transthoracic median 21 vs. 18, p {$<$} 0.001; transhiatal 15 vs. 13, p 0.007). Post-operative morbidity was comparable after transthoracic MIE and OE (60.8\% vs. 64.9\%, p 0.177), with a reduced length of stay after transthoracic MIE (median 12 vs. 15 days, p {$<$} 0.001). After transhiatal MIE, more postoperative complications (64.9\% vs. 56.4\%, p 0.034) were observed, without subsequent difference in length of stay. CONCLUSION: Long-term survival after minimally invasive esophagectomy was equivalent to open in both propensity-score matched cohorts of patients undergoing transthoracic or transhiatal esophageal resections. Transhiatal minimally invasive esophagectomy was accompanied with more post-operative morbidity. Both transthoracic and transhiatal minimally invasive esophagectomy resulted in a more extended lymphadenectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role and potential value of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in certain tumors has been widely investigated in recent years. The authors retrospectively assessed the performance of 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in the assessment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: The results using PET were compared with those using computed tomography (CT), and these were correlated with the pathologic findings. The authors studied 32 patients with thoracic esophageal SCC who had undergone radical esophagectomy. RESULTS: Uptake of FDG in the primary tumor was found in 25 of the 32 (78.1\%) cases. Comparison of the FDG uptake and the clinicopathologic findings showed that there was a significant association between the FDG uptake and each of the depth of tumor invasion (P {$<$} 0.05), occurrence of lymph node metastasis (P {$<$} 0.01), and lymphatic invasion (P {$<$} 0.01). The survival rate in cases with high FDG uptake (standardized uptake value [SUV], {$>$}3) was significantly lower than that in cases with low FDG uptake (SUV, {$<$} 3; P {$<$} 0.05). In the evaluation of lymph node staging by the detection of lymph node metastasis, FDG-PET showed 77.8\% sensitivity, 92.9\% specificity, and 84.4\% accuracy, and CT scanning showed 61.1\% sensitivity, 71.4\% specificity, and 65.6\% accuracy. Positron emission tomography scanning showed a high degree of accuracy in the neck, upper thoracic, and abdominal regions. However, in the mid- and lower thoracic regions, the sensitivity was very low. The smallest lymph node metastasis that was detected by FDG-PET imaging was 6 mm. The average size of lymph node metastasis that was undetected by FDG-PET scanning was 7.3 mm (range, 1-17 mm). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, FDG-PET may be used as a noninvasive diagnostic technique in assessing the aggressiveness of the tumor and the prognosis in patients with esophageal SCC. During the preoperative diagnostic procedures, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of lymph node staging is higher with FDG-PET than with CT imaging. In view of the high specificity of FDG-PET, it also gives useful information to guide the choice of treatment of esophageal carcinoma.},

  abstract = {Esophageal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Complete resection of esophageal cancer and adjacent malignant lymph nodes is the only potentially curative treatment. Accurate preoperative staging and assessment of therapeutic response after neoadjuvant therapy are crucial in determining the most suitable therapy and avoiding inappropriate attempts at curative surgery. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for initial imaging following confirmation of malignancy at pathologic analysis, primarily to rule out unresectable or distant metastatic disease. With the advent of multidetector CT, use of thin sections and multiplanar reformation allows more accurate staging of esophageal cancer. Endoscopic ultrasonography (US) is the best modality for determining the depth of tumor invasion and presence of regional lymph node involvement. Combined use of fine-needle aspiration and endoscopic US can improve assessment of lymph node involvement. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful for assessment of distant metastases but is not appropriate for detecting and staging primary tumors. PET may also be helpful in restaging after neoadjuvant therapy, since it allows identification of early response to treatment and detection of interval distant metastases. Each imaging modality has its advantages and disadvantages; therefore, CT, endoscopic US, and PET should be considered complementary modalities for preoperative staging and therapeutic monitoring of patients with esophageal cancer.},

RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients had more than 10\% WL compared to their weight at surgery. On univariate analysis, higher body mass index [(BMI): {$\geq$}20.8; p=0.012] and shorter length of hospitalization [(LOH); p=0.041] demonstrated an association with more than 10\% WL. On multivariate analysis, higher BMI [odds ratio (OR)=2.821; 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.238-6.426; p=0.014] and shorter LOH (OR=2.953; 95\% CI=1.009-8.646; p=0.048) were independently associated with more than 10\% WL.

In the pivotal Intergroup-0116 Phase III trial by Macdonald et all, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy improved both disease-free and overall survival in curatively resected patients with mainly gastric adenocarcinoma. We compared survival data for curatively resected patients with adeno-carcinoma solely at the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ), treated with surgery alone or surgery and adjuvant chemoradio-therapy. METHODS: From 2003 to 2009, 211 patients underwent curative resection. Surgery alone was performed in 95 pa-tients and 116 patients received adjuvant therapy after resection. All patients underwent Lewis-Tanner operation with D1 node resection including coliac nodes (D1+). Informations about recurrence and death were collected from the Danish Cancer Register and the Central Death Register. Patients who died after experiencing severe complications after surgery were excluded from the survival analysis. Patients with T0N0 or T1N0 were also excluded because patients of this category were not given adjuvant therapy according to the Macdonald protocol. RESULTS: Patients with positive node status in the resected specimen, the 3-year disease-free survival after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (n = 91) or surgery alone (n = 43) was 24\% and 37\%, respectively. Median time of survival was prolonged by 10 month in favour of those who received chemoradiotherapy. However, after controlling for the confounding effect of age and node status, only positive node status in the resected specimen had significant partial effect on survival. CONCLUSION: Chemoradiotherapy according to the Intergroup-0116 protocol might still be a reasonable option after curative resection in patients with GEJ adenocarcinomas and positive lymph node status, who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.},

METHODS: In total, 336 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent surgery between January 2011 and April 2017 were included in this study. We investigated the relationship between the CCI and postoperative nutrition indexes. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two groups: CCI {$\leq$}1 (low CCI group) and CCI {$\geq$}2 (high CCI group). A high CCI was significantly associated with shortened overall survival (OS; 3-year OS rate of 77.9\% in the low CCI group versus 59.7\% in the high CCI group; p~=~0.008). Nutritional indexes, such as the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), at 1~month after esophagectomy were significantly lower in the high CCI group than in the low CCI group (p~=~0.031); however, the PNI at 6 months after surgery was similar between the high and low CCI groups. Multivariate analysis identified high CCI as an independent risk factor associated with PNI {$<$}45 in esophageal cancer patients at 1 month after esophagectomy (p~=~0.047). CONCLUSION: This study showed that CCI {$\geq$}2 was significantly associated with poor PNI at 1 month after surgery for esophageal cancer, indicating that it is necessary to administer effective nutritional interventions for patients with postoperative malnutrition, especially those with multiple comorbidities.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma is associated with improved survival. The Southwest Oncology Group designed a trimodality, phase II, single-arm trial with objectives of achieving a pCR rate of 40\% with prospective exploratory analyses of intratumoral molecular markers postulated to affect response and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinically staged II or III esophageal adenocarcinoma received oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) on days 1, 15, and 29; protracted-infusion fluorouracil (PI-FU) 180 mg/m(2)/d on days 8 through 43; and external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) 5 days a week at 1.8 Gy/d for 25 fractions; surgery was performed 28 to 42 days after neoadjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy was planned after surgery. Tumors were analyzed for mRNA expression and polymorphisms in genes involved in drug metabolism and DNA repair. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were evaluable. Two deaths (2.2\%) were attributable to preoperative therapy, and two deaths (2.2\%) were attributable to surgery. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were recorded for 47.3\% and 19.4\% of patients, respectively. Seventy-nine patients (84.9\%) underwent surgery; 67.7\% of patients had R0 resections. Twenty-six patients (28.0\%) had confirmed pCR (95\% CI, 19.1\% to 38.2\%). At a median follow-up of 39.2 months, estimates of median and 3-year overall survival (OS) were 28.3 months and 45.1\%, respectively. Intratumoral ERCC-1 gene expression was inversely related to progression-free survival and OS. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, PI-FU, and EBRT for esophageal adenocarcinoma is active and tolerable. Because the regimen failed to meet the primary end point, it does not define a new standard. However, future trials can be built on this platform to validate the role of ERCC-1 in determining the best systemic regimen for individual patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention with smoking cessation starting 4 weeks before general and orthopedic surgery would reduce the frequency of postoperative complications. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Complications are a major concern after elective surgery and smokers have an increased risk. There is insufficient evidence concerning how the duration of preoperative smoking intervention affects postoperative complications. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, conducted between February 2004 and December 2006 at 4 university-affiliated hospitals in the Stockholm region, Sweden. The outcome assessment was blinded. The follow-up period for the primary outcome was 30 days. Eligibility criteria were active daily smokers, aged 18 to 79 years. Of the 238 patients assessed, 76 refused participating, and 117 men and women undergoing surgery for primary hernia repair, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or a hip or knee prosthesis were enrolled. INTERVENTION: Smoking cessation therapy with individual counseling and nicotine substitution started 4 weeks before surgery and continued 4 weeks postoperatively. The control group received standard care. The main outcome measure was frequency of any postoperative complication. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat analysis showed that the overall complication rate in the control group was 41\%, and in the intervention group, it was 21\% (P = 0.03). Relative risk reduction for the primary outcome of any postoperative complication was 49\% and number needed to treat was 5 (95\% CI, 3-40). An analysis per protocol showed that abstainers had fewer complications (15\%) than those who continued to smoke or only reduced smoking (35\%), although this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Perioperative smoking cessation seems to be an effective tool to reduce postoperative complications even if it is introduced as late as 4 weeks before surgery.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs provide a format for multidisciplinary care and has been shown to predictably improve short term outcomes associated with surgical procedures. Esophagectomy has historically been associated with significant levels of morbidity and mortality and as a result routine application and audit of ERAS guidelines specifically designed for esophageal resection has significant potential to improve outcomes associated with this complex procedure. METHODS: A team of international experts in the surgical management of esophageal cancer was assembled and the existing literature was identified and reviewed prior to the production of the guidelines. Well established procedure specific components of ERAS were reviewed and updated with changes relevant to esophagectomy. Procedure specific, operative and technical sections were produced utilizing the best current level of evidence. All sections were rated regarding the level of evidence and overall recommendation according to the evaluation (GRADE) system. RESULTS: Thirty-nine sections were ultimately produced and assessed for quality of evidence and recommendations. Some sections were completely new to ERAS programs due to the fact that esophagectomy is the first guideline with a thoracic component to the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The current ERAS society guidelines should be reviewed and applied in all centers looking to improve outcomes and quality associated with esophageal resection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for elderly patients with esophageal cancer (EC) remains controversial. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether elderly patients with stage II-III EC could benefit from trimodal therapy. METHODS: The selected elderly patients with stage II-III EC between 2004 and 2015 were included in a retrospective cohort study from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they underwent surgery. The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was used to balance the confounding factors between the two groups. The Cox regression analysis, the log-rank test, and the Kaplan-Meier curves were conducted to identify the survival benefits of different treatment regimes. RESULTS: A total of 1596 patients were included in this cohort study, in which 278 patients underwent surgery. In the combination of chemoradiotherapy and surgery group, there were more male patients, more patients aged between 75 and 79~years, and more married patients in the surgery group. Moreover, there were more patients with adenomatous carcinoma, more patients with a tumor size of less than 5~cm, and more patients with a T3~stage in the combination group. In the survival analysis, patients in the combination group had a longer overall survival (OS) and EC-specific survival (ECSS). After IPTW analysis, the survival analysis generated similar results. The competitive risk model found that our results were stable. There was still a significant difference in OS and ECSS between the combination group and chemoradiotherapy alone group for esophageal adenocarcinoma (p~{$<~$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with stage II-III EC, especially those with adenocarcinoma, could benefit from the combination of surgery and chemoradiotherapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical resection of adenocarcinoma of the stomach is curative in less than 40 percent of cases. We investigated the effect of surgery plus postoperative (adjuvant) chemoradiotherapy on the survival of patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. METHODS: A total of 556 patients with resected adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction were randomly assigned to surgery plus postoperative chemoradiotherapy or surgery alone. The adjuvant treatment consisted of 425 mg of fluorouracil per square meter of body-surface area per day, plus 20 mg of leucovorin per square meter per day, for five days, followed by 4500 cGy of radiation at 180 cGy per day, given five days per week for five weeks, with modified doses of fluorouracil and leucovorin on the first four and the last three days of radiotherapy. One month after the completion of radiotherapy, two five-day cycles of fluorouracil (425 mg per square meter per day) plus leucovorin (20 mg per square meter per day) were given one month apart. RESULTS: The median overall survival in the surgery-only group was 27 months, as compared with 36 months in the chemoradiotherapy group; the hazard ratio for death was 1.35 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.66; P=0.005). The hazard ratio for relapse was 1.52 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.86; P{$<$}0.001). Three patients (1 percent) died from toxic effects of the chemoradiotherapy; grade 3 toxic effects occurred in 41 percent of the patients in the chemoradiotherapy group, and grade 4 toxic effects occurred in 32 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative chemoradiotherapy should be considered for all patients at high risk for recurrence of adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction who have undergone curative resection.},

The aim of this study was to define national proficiency-gain curves for minimal access colorectal and oesophagogastric surgery, and to determine the impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: All adult patients undergoing minimal access oesophageal, colonic and rectal surgery between 2002 and 2012 were identified from the Hospital Episode Statistics database. Proficiency-gain curves were created using risk-adjusted cumulative sum analysis. Change points were identified, and bootstrapping was performed with 1000 iterations to identify a confidence level. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality; secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, reintervention, conversion and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Some 1696, 15\,008 and 16\,701 minimal access oesophageal, rectal and colonic cancer resections were performed during the study period. The change point in the proficiency-gain curve for 30-day mortality for oesophageal, rectal and colonic surgery was 19 (confidence level 98{$\cdot$}4 per cent), 20 (99{$\cdot$}2 per cent) and three (99{$\cdot$}5 per cent) procedures; the mortality rate fell from 4{$\cdot$}0 to 2{$\cdot$}0 per cent (relative risk reduction (RRR) 0{$\cdot$}50, P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}033), from 2{$\cdot$}1 to 1{$\cdot$}2 per cent (RRR 0{$\cdot$}43, P\,{$<$}\,0{$\cdot$}001) and from 2{$\cdot$}4 to 1{$\cdot$}8 per cent (RRR 0{$\cdot$}25, P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}058) respectively. The change point in the proficiency-gain curve for reintervention in oesophageal, rectal and colonic resection was 19 (98{$\cdot$}1 per cent), 32 (99{$\cdot$}5 per cent) and 26 (99{$\cdot$}2 per cent) procedures respectively. There were also significant proficiency-gain curves for 90-day mortality, conversion and length of stay. CONCLUSION: The introduction of minimal access gastrointestinal cancer surgery has been associated with a proficiency-gain curve for mortality and major morbidity at a national level. Unnecessary patient harm should be avoided by appropriate training and monitoring of new surgical techniques.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ablation and vagal-sparing esophagectomy offer the potential for reduced morbidity in patients with high-grade dysplasia or early esophageal adenocarcinoma, but neither includes a lymphadenectomy. Although adequate for intramucosal tumors, both are potentially inadequate for patients with submucosal tumor invasion given the high prevalence of nodal metastases with these lesions. Currently there is no test including endoscopic ultrasound that can accurately determine whether a small tumor is confined to the mucosa or has penetrated into the submucosa. The aim of this study was to compare the pathologic depth of invasion by endoscopic mucosal resection with findings and outcome after surgical resection to assess the accuracy and reliability of endoscopic mucosal resection for staging early esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: From 2001 to 2003, 7 patients presented with small, endoscopically visible adenocarcinomas. All underwent endoscopic mucosal resection followed by surgical resection. RESULTS: Analysis of the resected specimens confirmed that the endoscopic mucosal resection had accurately determined the depth of tumor invasion in all patients, and had completely excised the lesion in all but 1 patient (86\%). Lymph node dissection was included as part of the resection in 2 patients with submucosal invasion by endoscopic mucosal resection, and a vagal-sparing esophagectomy was used in the 5 patients with only intramucosal tumors. All patients are alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic mucosal resection accurately determines the depth of tumor invasion, and should be used as a staging procedure in patients with early esophageal cancer when therapies that do not include a lymphadenectomy are considered.},

  abstract = {The objective of this systematic review is to identify key components of enhanced recovery protocols (ERP) that lead to improved length of hospital stay (LOS) following esophagectomy. Relevant electronic databases were searched for studies comparing clinical outcome from esophagectomy followed by a conventional pathway versus ERP. Relevant outcome measures were compared and metaregression was performed to identify the key ERP components associated with reduced in LOS. Thirteen publications were included, ERP was associated with no changes in in-hospital mortality, total complications, anastomotic leak, or pulmonary complications compared with a conventional pathway, however LOS was reduced in the ERP group. Metaregression identified that immediate extubation was associated with reduced LOS (OR = -0.51, 95\%CI -0.77 to -0.25; P~{$<~$}0.01). Several postoperative factors were associated with a significant reduction in length of hospital stay, and in order of most important were (i) gastrograffin swallow {$\leq$}5 days (OR = -4.27, 95\%CI -4.50 to -4.03); (ii) mobilization on postoperative day {$\leq$}1 (OR = -2.49, 95\%CI -2.63 to -2.34); (iii) removal of urinary catheter {$\leq$}2 days (OR = -0.99, 95\%CI -1.15 to -0.84); (iv) oral intake with at least sips of fluid {$\leq$}1 day (OR = -0.96, 95\%CI -1.24 to -0.68); (v) enteral diet with feeding jejunostomy or gastrostomy {$\leq~$}1 day (OR = -0.57, 95\%CI -0.80 to -0.35) and (vi) epidural removal {$\leq~$}4 days (OR = -0.17, 95\%CI -0.27 to -0.07). Several core ERP components and principles appear to be associated with LOS reduction. These elements should form a part of the core ERP for the specialty, while surgical teams incorporate other elements through an iterative process.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to identify the presence and length of esophagectomy proficiency gain curves in terms of short- and long-term mortality for esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between 1987 and 2010 with follow-up until 2014 were identified from a well-established, population-based, nationwide Swedish cohort study. Proficiency gain curves were created by using risk-adjusted cumulative sum analysis for 30-day, 90-day, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year all-cause and disease-specific mortality measures. Similarly, the proficiency gain curves for lymph node harvest, resection margin status, and reoperation incidence were assessed as performance-contributing factors to the observed changes in long-term survival. RESULTS: Esophagectomies in 1,821 patients with esophageal cancer were conducted by 139 surgeons. The change-point in proficiency gain curve for all-cause 30-day mortality was early, at 15 cases, when mortality decreased from 7.9\% to 3.1\% (P {$<$} .001). Later change-points, which ranged from 35 to 59 cases, were observed for 1-, 3- and 5-year mortality rates, for which all-cause mortality decreased from 34.9\% to 27.7\% (P = .011), from 47.4\% to 41.5\% (P = .049), and from 31.4\% to 19.1\% (P = .009), respectively. Similar change-points were observed in disease-specific mortality at 1 and 3 years. There was a continuous increase in lymph node harvest, which did not plateau. Also, change-points were observed for resection margin with tumor involvement at 17 cases, with a reduction from 20.9\% to 15.2\% (P = .004), and for reoperation rate at 55 cases, with a reduction from 12.6\% to 5.0\% (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: The gain of proficiency in esophagectomy for cancer is associated with measurable changes in short- and long-term mortality results. These findings indicate a need for structured national training and mentorship programs for esophageal cancer surgery.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The aims of this study were to compare short- and long-term outcomes for clinical T2N0 oesophageal cancer with analysis of (i) primary surgery (S) versus neoadjuvant therapy plus surgery (NS), (ii) squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma subsets; and (iii) neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Data were collected from 30 European centres from 2000 to 2010. Among 2944 included patients, 355 patients (12.1\%) had cT2N0 disease; 285 (S) and 70 (NS), were compared in terms of short- and long-term outcomes. Propensity score matching analyses were used to compensate for differences in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: No significant differences between the groups were shown in terms of in hospital morbidity and mortality. Nodal disease was observed in 50\% of S-group at the time of surgery, with 20\% pN2/N3. Utilisation of neoadjuvant therapy was associated with significant tumour downstaging as reflected by increases in pT0, pN0 and pTNM stage 0 disease, this effect was further enhanced with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. After adjustment on propensity score and confounding factors, for all patients and subset analysis of squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, neoadjuvant therapy had no significant effect upon survival or recurrence (overall, loco-regional, distant or mixed) compared to surgery alone. There were no significant differences between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in short- or long-term outcomes. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that a surgery alone treatment approach should be recommended as the primary treatment approach for cT2N0 oesophageal cancer despite 50\% of patients having nodal disease at the time of surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Combined chemoradiotherapy is increasingly being used as definitive treatment for locoregional esophageal malignancy. Patients with residual or recurrent localized cancer are often selectively considered for salvage esophagectomy (SALV). The aim of this pooled analysis was to compare short-term clinical outcomes from SALV following definitive chemoradiotherapy with those from planned esophagectomy following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRS). METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists were searched for relevant comparative studies. Primary outcome measures were in-hospital mortality, anastomotic leak and pulmonary complications. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, negative (R0) resection margin, and estimated blood loss. RESULTS: Eight studies comprising 954 patients; 242 (SALV) and 712 (NCRS) were included. SALV was associated with a significantly increased incidence of post-operative mortality (9.50 vs. 4.07 \%; pooled odds ratio [POR] = 3.02; p {$<$} 0.001), anastomotic leak (23.97 vs. 14.47 \%; POR = 1.99; p = 0.005), pulmonary complications (29.75 vs. 16.99 \%; POR = 2.12; p {$<$} 0.001), and an increased length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference = 8.29 days; 95 \% CI 7.08-9.5; p {$<$} 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of negative resection margins or estimated blood loss. CONCLUSIONS: SALV has poorer short-term outcomes when compared with planned esophagectomy following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and multidisciplinary tumor boards should be made aware of these differences in outcomes and SALV should be reserved for practice in high-volume institutions.},

METHODS: A nationwide cohort study was conducted in Sweden in 2001-2004, with follow-up to 2008. Weight was assessed before oesophagectomy, after 6 months and at 3 years. Logistic regression was performed with adjustment for confounders. Odds ratios (ORs) for postoperative weight loss of at least 15 per cent were estimated. RESULTS: Some 203 patients survived at least 3 years after oesophagectomy. Continuous weight loss occurred for up to 3 years. Women and men had a similar risk of malnutrition after 3 years (OR 0.85 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.24 to 2.98)). In overweight patients (preoperative body mass index at least 25 kg/m(2)) the risk of malnutrition was increased almost fivefold at 6 months (OR 4.90 (2.27 to 10.59)) and 3 years (OR 4.60 (1.80 to 11.78)). There was no difference in weight loss at 6 months between survivors and those who died between 6 months and 3 years after surgery (OR 1.11 (0.64 to 1.94)). CONCLUSION: Weight loss can be long lasting after oesophagectomy; overweight patients are at particularly increased risk of malnutrition.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The influence of preoperative hemoglobin levels on outcomes of patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer is not clearly defined. The goal of this article was to explore the association between combined modality therapy, preoperative anemia status, and perioperative blood transfusion and risk of postoperative complications among patients undergoing esophageal resection. METHODS: From a retrospective esophageal database, 413 patients were identified. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization classification of {$<$}13 g/dL or {$<$}12 g/dL for men or women, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance, Pearson's chi(2), or Fisher exact test as appropriate. The independent association of anemia, blood transfusion, and combined modality treatment on risk of postoperative complications were examined using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Information on combined modality treatment, preoperative hemoglobin levels, and blood transfusion was available for 413 patients, of whom 57\% received combined modality treatment. Overall 197 (47.6\%) patients were preoperatively found to be anemic, and those who had received combined modality treatment were more likely to be anemic (60.6\% versus 30.7\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Anemic patients required more blood transfusions than nonanemic patients (46.7\% versus 29.6\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Seventy-five percent of patients who required transfusion during the hospital stay had received combined modality treatment (P = 0.01). Combined modality treatment and anemia were not associated with increased risk of complications. Patients with any perioperative complication and surgical site infections were more likely to have received blood transfusion compared to patients without complications (OR = 1.73; 95\% CI 1.04-2.87 and OR = 2.98; 95\% CI 1.04-8.55; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we determined that administration of neoadjuvant treatment to esophageal cancer patients was not associated with an increased rate of perioperative complications. Preoperative anemia did not predict worsened short-term outcomes, but increased the chances of red blood cell transfusion, which were significantly associated with higher overall complications and increased risk of surgical site infections. These data confirm previous studies that allogenic red blood cell transfusions are independent risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality and should be minimized during surgery for esophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Often curative treatment for locally advanced resectable esophageal or gastro-esophageal junctional cancer consists of concurrent neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by surgery. Currently, one of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens in this setting is a combination of a fluoropyrimidin and of a platinum analogue. Due to the promising results of the recent CROSS trial, another regimen combining paclitaxel and carboplatin is also widely used by European and American centers. No clinical study has shown the superiority of one treatment over the other. The objective of this Phase II study is to clarify clinical practice by comparing these two chemotherapy treatments. Our aim is to evaluate, in operable esophageal and gastro-esophageal junctional cancer, the complete resection rate and severe postoperative morbidity rate associated with these two neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens (carboplatin-paclitaxel or fluorouracil-oxaliplatin-folinic acid) when each is combined with the radiation regime utilized in the CROSS trial. METHODS/DESIGN: PROTECT is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open arms, phase II trial. Eligible patients will have a histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and be treated with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by surgery for stage IIB or stage III resectable esophageal cancer. A total of 106 patients will be randomized to receive either 3~cycles of FOLFOX combined to concurrent radiotherapy (41.4 Grays) or carboplatin and paclitaxel with the same radiation regimen, using a 1:1 allocation ratio. DISCUSSION: This ongoing trial offers the unique opportunity to compare two standards of chemotherapy delivered with a common regimen of preoperative radiation, in the setting of operable locally advanced esophageal or gastro-esophageal junctional tumors.

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a protective ventilatory strategy to reduce systemic inflammation in patients undergoing esophagectomy. METHODS: The authors prospectively investigated 52 patients undergoing planned esophagectomy for cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to a conventional ventilation strategy (n = 26; tidal volume of 9 ml/kg during two-lung and one-lung ventilation; no positive end-expiratory pressure) or a protective ventilation strategy (n = 26; tidal volume of 9 ml/kg during two-lung ventilation, reduced to 5 ml/kg during one-lung ventilation; positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O throughout the operative time). RESULTS: Plasmatic levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured perioperatively and postoperatively. Pulmonary function and postoperative evolution were also evaluated. Patients who received protective strategy had lower blood levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 at the end of one-lung ventilation (0.24 [0.15-0.40] vs. 0.56 [0.38-0.89] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; 91 [61-117] vs. 189 [127-294] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; and 30 [22-45] vs. 49 [29-69] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.05, respectively) and 18 h postoperatively (0.18 [0.13-0.30] vs. 0.43 [0.34-0.54] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; 54 [36-89] vs. 116 [78-208] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; 16 [11-24] vs. 35 [28-53] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001, respectively).

  abstract = {Background Self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) insertion and percutaneous gastrostomy (PG) feeding are commonly used for patients with esophageal cancer and dysphagia. This study aimed to compare outcomes between SEMS insertion and PG feeding for them. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 308 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent fully covered SEMS insertion (stent group) or PG (gastrostomy group) for dysphagia due to tumor. Patients with other causes of dysphagia, such as radiation-induced or postoperative stricture, were excluded from the study. Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups, including overall survival and need for additional intervention and postprocedural nutritional status. Results At baseline, the stent group (n = 169) had more stage IV patients, less cervical cancers, and received radiotherapy and esophagectomy less often than the gastrostomy group (n = 64). The Kaplan-Meier curves showed higher overall survival in the gastrostomy group than in the stent group. Multivariate analysis revealed that PG was associated with better survival compared with SEMS insertion (hazard ratio 0.541, 95\% confidence interval 0.346\textendash 0.848, p = 0.007). In addition, the gastrostomy group needed additional intervention less often (3.1\% vs. 21.9\%, p {$<$} 0.001) and experienced less decrease in serum albumin levels (-0.15 {$\pm$} 0.56 g/dL vs. -0.39 {$\pm$} 0.58 g/dL, p = 0.011) than the stent group after procedure. Conclusions Our data suggested that, compared with SEMS insertion, PG is associated with better overall survival in patients with esophageal cancer and dysphagia. Stabilized nutritional status by PG may play a role in improving patient survival.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the local/regional control, survival, and toxicity of combined-modality therapy using high-dose (64.8 Gy) versus standard-dose (50.4 Gy) radiation therapy for the treatment of patients with esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 236 patients with clinical stage T1 to T4, N0/1, M0 squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma selected for a nonsurgical approach, after stratification by weight loss, primary tumor size, and histology, were randomized to receive combined-modality therapy consisting of four monthly cycles of fluorouracil (5-FU) (1,000 mg/m(2)/24 hours for 4 days) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) bolus day 1) with concurrent 64.8 Gy versus the same chemotherapy schedule but with concurrent 50.4 Gy. The trial was stopped after an interim analysis. The median follow-up was 16.4 months for all patients and 29.5 months for patients still alive. RESULTS: For the 218 eligible patients, there was no significant difference in median survival (13.0 v 18.1 months), 2-year survival (31\% v 40\%), or local/regional failure and local/regional persistence of disease (56\% v 52\%) between the high-dose and standard-dose arms. Although 11 treatment-related deaths occurred in the high-dose arm compared with two in the standard-dose arm, seven of the 11 deaths occurred in patients who had received 50.4 Gy or less. CONCLUSION: The higher radiation dose did not increase survival or local/regional control. Although there was a higher treatment-related mortality rate in the patients assigned to the high-dose radiation arm, it did not seem to be related to the higher radiation dose. The standard radiation dose for patients treated with concurrent 5-FU and cisplatin chemotherapy is 50.4 Gy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) plus surgery is a standard treatment for locally advanced oesophageal cancer. With this treatment, 29\% of patients have a pathologically complete response in the resection specimen. This provides the rationale for investigating an active surveillance approach. The aim of this study is to assess the (cost-)effectiveness of active surveillance vs. standard oesophagectomy after nCRT for oesophageal cancer. METHODS: This is a phase-III multi-centre, stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial. A total of 300 patients with clinically complete response (cCR, i.e. no local or disseminated disease proven by histology) after nCRT will be randomised to show non-inferiority of active surveillance to standard oesophagectomy (non-inferiority margin 15\%, intra-correlation coefficient 0.02, power 80\%, 2-sided {$\alpha$} 0.05, 12\% drop-out). Patients will undergo a first clinical response evaluation (CRE-I) 4-6~weeks after nCRT, consisting of endoscopy with bite-on-bite biopsies of the primary tumour site and other suspected lesions. Clinically complete responders will undergo a second CRE (CRE-II), 6-8~weeks after CRE-I. CRE-II will include 18F-FDG-PET-CT, followed by endoscopy with bite-on-bite biopsies and ultra-endosonography plus fine needle aspiration of suspected lymph nodes and/or PET- positive lesions. Patients with cCR at CRE-II will be assigned to oesophagectomy (first phase) or active surveillance (second phase of the study). The duration of the first phase is determined randomly over the 12 centres, i.e., stepped-wedge cluster design. Patients in the active surveillance arm will undergo diagnostic evaluations similar to CRE-II at 6/9/12/16/20/24/30/36/48 and 60~months after nCRT. In this arm, oesophagectomy will be offered only to patients in whom locoregional regrowth is highly suspected or proven, without distant dissemination. The main study parameter is overall survival; secondary endpoints include percentage of patients who do not undergo surgery, quality of life, clinical irresectability (cT4b) rate, radical resection rate, postoperative complications, progression-free survival, distant dissemination rate, and cost-effectiveness. We hypothesise that active surveillance leads to non-inferior survival, improved quality of life and a reduction in costs, compared to standard oesophagectomy. DISCUSSION: If active surveillance and surgery as needed after nCRT leads to non-inferior survival compared to standard oesophagectomy, this organ-sparing approach can be implemented as a standard of care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: After neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for oesophageal cancer, roughly half of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma and a quarter of those with adenocarcinoma have a pathological complete response of the primary tumour before surgery. Thus, the necessity of standard oesophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be reconsidered for patients who respond sufficiently to neoadjuvant treatment. In this study, we aimed to establish the accuracy of detection of residual disease after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with different diagnostic approaches, and the optimal combination of diagnostic techniques for clinical response evaluations. METHODS: The preSANO trial was a prospective, multicentre, diagnostic cohort study at six centres in the Netherlands. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had histologically proven, resectable, squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or oesophagogastric junction, and were eligible for potential curative therapy with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (five weekly cycles of carboplatin [area under the curve 2 mg/mL per min] plus paclitaxel [50 mg/m2 of body-surface area] combined with 41{$\cdot$}4 Gy radiotherapy in 23 fractions) followed by oesophagectomy. 4-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients had oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies and endoscopic ultrasonography with measurement of maximum tumour thickness. Patients with histologically proven locoregional residual disease or no-pass during endoscopy and without distant metastases underwent immediate surgical resection. In the remaining patients a second clinical response evaluation was done (PET-CT, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies, endoscopic ultrasonography with measurement of maximum tumour thickness, and fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes), followed by surgery 12-14 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The primary endpoint was the correlation between clinical response during clinical response evaluations and the final pathological response in resection specimens, as shown by the proportion of tumour regression grade (TRG) 3 or 4 ({$>$}10\% residual carcinoma in the resection specimen) residual tumours that was missed during clinical response evaluations. This study was registered with the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR4834), and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between July 22, 2013, and Dec 28, 2016, 219 patients were included, 207 of whom were included in the analyses. Eight of 26 TRG3 or TRG4 tumours (31\% [95\% CI 17-50]) were missed by endoscopy with regular biopsies and fine-needle aspiration. Four of 41 TRG3 or TRG4 tumours (10\% [95\% CI 4-23]) were missed with bite-on-bite biopsies and fine-needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasonography with maximum tumour thickness measurement missed TRG3 or TRG4 residual tumours in 11 of 39 patients (28\% [95\% CI 17-44]). PET-CT missed six of 41 TRG3 or TRG4 tumours (15\% [95\% CI 7-28]). PET-CT detected interval distant histologically proven metastases in 18 (9\%) of 190 patients (one squamous cell carcinoma, 17 adenocarcinomas). INTERPRETATION: After neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for oesophageal cancer, clinical response evaluation with endoscopic ultrasonography, bite-on-bite biopsies, and fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes was adequate for detection of locoregional residual disease, with PET-CT for detection of interval metastases. Active surveillance with this combination of diagnostic modalities is now being assessed in a phase 3 randomised controlled trial (SANO trial; Netherlands Trial Register NTR6803).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare overall survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who underwent transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) with limited lymphadenectomy or transthoracic esophagectomy (TTE) with extended lymphadenectomy with or without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). BACKGROUND: The application of neoadjuvant therapy might change the association between the extent of lymphadenectomy and survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. This may influence the choice of surgical approach in patients treated with nCRT. METHODS: Patients with potentially curable subcarinal esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with surgery alone or nCRT followed by surgery in 7 centers were included. The effect of surgical approach on overall survival, differentiated by the addition or omission of nCRT, was analyzed using a multivariable Cox regression model that included well-known prognostic factors and factors that might have influenced the choice of surgical approach. RESULTS: In total, 701 patients were included, of whom 318 had TTE with extended lymphadenectomy and 383 had THE with limited lymphadenectomy. TTE had differential effects on survival (P for interaction = 0.02), with a more favorable prognostic effect in patients who were treated with surgery alone [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-1.03]. This association was statistically significant in a subgroup of patients with 1 to 8 positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen (HR = 0.62, 95\% CI 0.43-0.90). The favorable prognostic effect of TTE over THE was absent in the nCRT and surgery group (HR = 1.16, 95\% CI 0.80-1.66) and in the subgroup of nCRT patients with 1 to 8 positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen (HR = 1.00, 95\% CI 0.61-1.68). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to surgery alone, the addition of nCRT may reduce the need for TTE with extended lymphadenectomy to improve long-term survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.},

Median patient age was 69 years, and the median follow-up was 3.25 years. In patients with HGD, at the time of last endoscopy, the complete eradication rate of HGD was 84 \% and cancer-specific survival was 100 \%. During surveillance, one patient developed an invasive carcinoma that required endoscopic therapy. Patients with T1a and negative deep margins on ER had a recurrence-free and cancer-specific survival of 100 \%. There were seven patients with T1b and negative margins on ER. Three patients underwent esophagectomy; final pathology revealed no residual malignancy or lymph node metastasis. Two patients had definitive chemoradiation, and two patients were observed. To date, there has been no cancer recurrence. In all patients who underwent ER, there was one episode of bleeding that required endoscopic treatment and admission for observation. CONCLUSIONS: ER can be performed safely and can adequately stage and often treat patients with HGD and superficial cancers. Patients with HGD and T1a disease with negative margins are cured with ER alone. Observation and surveillance may be an option for select patients with low-risk, early submucosal disease (T1b) and negative margins.},

  abstract = {Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancer killers in our country. The effects of racial disparities on care for esophageal cancer patients are incompletely understood. Using the National Cancer Database, we investigated racial disparities in treatment and outcome of esophageal cancer patients. The National Cancer Database was queried from 2004 to 2017. Logistic regression and survival analysis were used to determine racial differences in access, treatment and outcome. A total of 127,098 patients were included. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95\% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery).There are racial disparities in the treatment of esophageal cancer. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians have improved overall survival versus Caucasians. African Americans have the worst overall survival. Racial disparities likely affect outcome in esophageal cancer. But other factors, such as epigenetics and tumor biology, may correlate more strongly with outcome for patients with esophageal cancer.},

DESIGN: Prospective consecutive series in which all patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing. SETTING: CPX laboratory and level 3 ICU and high-dependency unit (HDU) of a metropolitan teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Five hundred forty-eight patients {$>$}60 years of age (or younger with known cardiopulmonary disease) scheduled for major intra-abdominal surgery. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were assigned to one of three management strategies (ICU, HDU, or ward) based on the anaerobic threshold (deltaT) and ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia as determined by CPX testing that was performed as part of the presurgery evaluation, and by the expected oxygen demand stress of the surgical procedure. RESULTS: Overall mortality was 3.9\%. Forty-three percent of deaths were attributed to poor cardiopulmonary function, as detected preoperatively. There were no deaths related to cardiopulmonary complications in any patient deemed fit for major abdominal surgery and ward management, as determined by CPX testing. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients undergoing major intra-abdominal surgery, the AT, as determined by CPX testing, is an excellent predictor of mortality from cardiopulmonary causes in the postoperative period. Preoperative screening using CPX testing allowed the identification of high-risk patients and the appropriate selection of perioperative management.},

BACKGROUND: A randomized trial was performed to compare surgical techniques. Complete 5-year survival data are now available. METHODS: A total of 220 patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus (type I) or gastric cardia involving the distal esophagus (type II) were randomly assigned to limited transhiatal esophagectomy or to extended transthoracic esophagectomy with en bloc lymphadenectomy. Patients with peroperatively irresectable/incurable cancer were excluded from this analysis (n = 15). A total of 95 patients underwent transhiatal esophagectomy and 110 patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy. RESULTS: After transhiatal and transthoracic resection, 5-year survival was 34\% and 36\%, respectively (P = 0.71, per protocol analysis). In a subgroup analysis, based on the location of the primary tumor according to the resection specimen, no overall survival benefit for either surgical approach was seen in 115 patients with a type II tumor (P = 0.81). In 90 patients with a type I tumor, a survival benefit of 14\% was seen with the transthoracic approach (51\% vs. 37\%, P = 0.33). There was evidence that the treatment effect differed depending on the number of positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen (test for interaction P = 0.06). In patients (n = 55) without positive nodes locoregional disease-free survival after transhiatal esophagectomy was comparable to that after transthoracic esophagectomy (86\% and 89\%, respectively). The same was true for patients (n = 46) with more than 8 positive nodes (0\% in both groups). Patients (n = 104) with 1 to 8 positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen showed a 5-year locoregional disease-free survival advantage if operated via the transthoracic route (23\% vs. 64\%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: There is no significant overall survival benefit for either approach. However, compared with limited transhiatal resection extended transthoracic esophagectomy for type I esophageal adenocarcinoma shows an ongoing trend towards better 5-year survival. Moreover, patients with a limited number of positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen seem to benefit from an extended transthoracic esophagectomy.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Recurrence pattern was analyzed in patients from the previously published CROSS I and II trials in relation to radiation target volumes. CRT consisted of five weekly courses of paclitaxel and carboplatin combined with a concurrent radiation dose of 41.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions to the tumor and pathologic lymph nodes with margin. RESULTS: Of the 422 patients included from 2001 to 2008, 418 were available for analysis. Histology was mostly adenocarcinoma (75\%). Of the 374 patients who underwent resection, 86\% were allocated to surgery and 92\% to CRT plus surgery. On January 1, 2011, after a minimum follow-up of 24 months (median, 45 months), the overall recurrence rate in the surgery arm was 58\% versus 35\% in the CRT plus surgery arm. Preoperative CRT reduced locoregional recurrence (LRR) from 34\% to 14\% (P {$<$} .001) and peritoneal carcinomatosis from 14\% to 4\% (P {$<$} .001). There was a small but significant effect on hematogenous dissemination in favor of the CRT group (35\% v 29\%; P = .025). LRR occurred in 5\% within the target volume, in 2\% in the margins, and in 6\% outside the radiation target volume. In 1\%, the exact site in relation to the target volume was unclear. Only 1\% had an isolated infield recurrence after CRT plus surgery. CONCLUSION: Preoperative CRT in patients with esophageal cancer reduced LRR and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Recurrence within the radiation target volume occurred in only 5\%, mostly combined with outfield failures.},

The objective of this study was to review the authors' 30-year experience with THE and changing trends in its use. METHODS: Using the authors' prospective Esophagectomy Database, this single institution experience with THE was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Two thousand and seven THEs were performed-1063 (previously reported) between 1976 and 1998 (group I) and 944 from 1998 to 2006 (group II), 24\% for benign disease, 76\%, cancer. THE was possible in 98\%. Stomach was the esophageal substitute in 97\%. Comparing outcomes between group I and group II, statistically significant differences (P {$<$} 0.001) were observed in hospital mortality (4\% vs. 1\%); adenocarcinoma histology (69\% vs. 86\%); use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (28\% vs. 52\%); mean blood loss (677 vs. 368 mL); anastomotic leak (14\% vs. 9\%); and discharge within 10 days (52\% vs. 78\%). Major complications remain infrequent: wound infection/dehiscence, 3\%, atelectasis/pneumonia, 2\%, intrathoracic hemorrhage, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, chylothorax, and tracheal laceration, {$<$}1\% each. Late functional results have been good or excellent in 73\%. Aggressive preoperative conditioning, avoiding the ICU, improved pain management, and early ambulation reduce length of stay, with 50\% in group II discharged within 1 week. CONCLUSION: THE refinements have reduced the historic morbidity and mortality of esophageal resection. This largest reported THE experience reinforces the value of consistent technique and a clinical pathway in managing these high acuity esophageal patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Malnutrition is common after oesophageal cancer surgery. This study aims to investigate body mass index (BMI) kinetics and the risk factors of malnutrition among 1-year disease-free survivors after radical transthoracic oesophagectomy for cancer. METHODS: From a prospective single-institution database, 118 1-year disease-free survivors having undergone a R0 transthoracic oesophagectomy with gastric tubulization between 2000 and 2008 were identified retrospectively. BMI values were collected at the onset of the disease (pre-treatment BMI), at the time of surgery (preoperative BMI), at postoperative 6 months and 1 year after oesophagectomy (1-year BMI). Logistic regression was performed with adjustment for confounders to estimate odds ratios of the factors associated with a 1-year weight loss (WL) of at least 15\% of the pre-treatment body weight (BW). RESULTS: At the onset of the disease, 5 patients (4\%) were underweighted (BMI {$<$} 8.5 kg/m\&sup2;), 65 (55\%) were normal (BMI = 18.5-24.9 kg/m\&sup2;), 36 (31\%) were overweighted (BMI {$>$} 25 kg/m\&sup2;) and 12 (10\%) were obese (BMI {$>$} 30 kg/m\&sup2;). Mean pre-treatment, preoperative, postoperative 6-month and 1-year BMI values were 24.64 {$\pm$} 4 kg/m\&sup2;, 23.55 {$\pm$} 3.8 kg/m\&sup2;, 21.7 {$\pm$} 3 kg/m\&sup2; and 21.97 {$\pm$} 4 kg/m\&sup2;, respectively. One-year WL {$\geq$} 15\% of the pre-treatment BW was present in 29 patients (25\%): 18 among the 48 patients (37\%) with a pre-treatment BMI {$\geq$} 25 and 11 among the 70 patients (15\%) with pre-treatment BMI {$<$} 25 (P = 0.006). On logistic regression, initial overweighting was the sole independent prognosticator of 1-year postoperative WL of at least 15\% of the pre-treatment BW (P = 0.039; OR: 2.96, [1.06-8.32]). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative malnutrition remains a severe problem after oesophageal cancer resection, even in long-term disease-free survivors. Overweight and obese patients are the segment population most exposed to this postoperative malnutrition, suggesting that such surgery could have substantial bariatric effect. A special vigilance programme on the nutritional status of this sub-group of patients should be the rule.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of data collected from the state cancer registry maintained by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. We identified patients with an esophageal cancer diagnosis between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013. {$\chi$}2 test and logistics regression were used to analyze 6,809 patients who met our eligibility criteria. Statistical significance was defined as P {$\leq$} .05. RESULTS: Approximately 88.4\% of our patients were White and 11.6\% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9\% v 31.8\%, respectively; P {$<$} .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment. CONCLUSION: Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This network meta-analysis compared overall survival after neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy (RT), or combinations of both (chemoradiotherapy, CRT) or surgery alone to identify the most effective approach. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The optimal treatment for resectable esophageal cancer is unknown. METHODS: A search for randomized controlled trials reporting on neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies was conducted. Using a network meta-analysis, treatments were ranked based on their effectiveness for improving survival. RESULTS: In 33 eligible randomized controlled trials, 6072 patients were randomized to receive either surgery alone (N = 2459) or neoadjuvant CT (N = 1332), RT (N = 58), and CRT (N = 1196) followed by surgery or surgery followed by adjuvant CT (N = 542), RT (N = 383), and CRT (N = 102). Twenty-one comparisons were generated. Neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery compared with surgery alone was the only treatment to significantly improve survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-0.87]. When trials were grouped considering neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies and surgery alone, neoadjuvant therapies combined with surgery compared with surgery alone showed a survival advantage (HR = 0.83, 95\% CI 0.76-0.90), whereas surgery along with adjuvant therapies showed no significant survival advantage (HR = 0.87, 95\% CI 0.67-1.14). A subgroup analysis of neoadjuvant therapies showed a superior effectiveness of neoadjuvant CRT and surgery compared with surgery alone (HR = 0.77, 95\% CI 0.68-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis showed neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery to be the most effective strategy in improving survival of resectable esophageal cancer. Resources should be focused on developing the most effective neoadjuvant CRT regimens for both adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus.},

This report provides 5 year follow-up data from a large prospective study investigating the efficacy and safety of endoscopic treatment in these patients and analysing risk factors for recurrence. DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: Academic tertiary care centre. PATIENTS: Between October 1996 and September 2002, 61 patients with HGIN and 288 with BC were included (173 with short-segment and 176 with long-segment Barrett's oesophagus) from a total of 486 patients presenting with Barrett's neoplasia. Patients with submucosal or more advanced cancer were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of complete remission and recurrence rate, tumour-associated death. RESULTS: Endoscopic resection was performed in 279 patients, photodynamic therapy in 55, and both procedures in 13; two patients received argon plasma coagulation. The mean follow-up period was 63.6 (SD 23.1) months. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 337 patients (96.6\%); surgery was necessary in 13 (3.7\%) after endoscopic therapy failed. Metachronous lesions developed during the follow-up in 74 patients (21.5\%); 56 died of concomitant disease, but none died of BC. The calculated 5 year survival rate was 84\%. The risk factors most frequently associated with recurrence were piecemeal resection, long-segment Barrett's oesophagus, no ablative therapy of Barrett's oesophagus after CR, time until CR achieved {$>$}10 months and multifocal neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that endoscopic therapy was highly effective and safe, with an excellent long-term survival rate. The risk factors identified may help stratify patients who are at risk for recurrence and those requiring more intensified follow-up.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Barrett's esophagus-associated high-grade dysplasia is commonly treated by endoscopy. However, most guidelines offer no recommendations for endoscopic treatment of mucosal adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (mAC). We investigated the efficacy and safety of endoscopic resection in a large series of patients with mAC. METHODS: We collected data from 1000 consecutive patients (mean age, 69.1 {$\pm$} 10.7 years; 861 men) with mAC (481 with short-segment and 519 with long-segment Barrett's esophagus) who presented at a tertiary care center from October 1996 to September 2010. Patients with low-grade and high-grade dysplasia and submucosal or more advanced cancer were excluded. All patients underwent endoscopic resection of mACs. Patients found to have submucosal cancer at their first endoscopy examination were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 56.6 {$\pm$} 33.4 months, 963 patients (96.3\%) had achieved a complete response; surgery was necessary in 12 patients (3.7\%) after endoscopic therapy failed. Metachronous lesions or recurrence of cancer developed during the follow-up period in 140 patients (14.5\%) but endoscopic re-treatment was successful in 115, resulting in a long-term complete remission rate of 93.8\%; 111 died of concomitant disease and 2 of Barrett's esophagus-associated cancer. The calculated 10-year survival rate of patients who underwent endoscopic resection of mACs was 75\%. Major complications developed in 15 patients (1.5\%) but could be managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic therapy is highly effective and safe for patients with mAC, with excellent long-term results. In an almost 5-year follow-up of 1000 patients treated with endoscopic resection, there was no mortality and less than 2\% had major complications. Endoscopic therapy should become the standard of care for patients with mAC.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A short course of radiotherapy is commonly prescribed for palliative relief of malignant dysphagia in patients with incurable oesophageal cancer. We compared chemoradiotherapy with radiotherapy alone for dysphagia relief in the palliative setting. METHODS: This multicentre randomised controlled trial included patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal cancer who were randomly assigned (1:1) through a computer-generated adaptive biased coin design to either palliative chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for treatment of malignant dysphagia at 22 hospitals in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK. Eligible patients had biopsy-proven oesophageal cancer that was unsuitable for curative treatment, symptomatic dysphagia, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and adequate haematological and renal function. Patients were stratified by hospital, dysphagia score (Mellow scale 1-4), and presence of metastases. The radiotherapy dose was 35 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks for patients in Australia and New Zealand and 30 Gy in ten fractions over 2 weeks for patients in Canada and the UK. Chemotherapy consisted of one cycle of intravenous cisplatin (either 80 mg/m2 on day 1 or 20 mg/m2 per day on days 1-4 of radiotherapy at clinician's discretion) and intravenous fluorouracil 800 mg/m2 per day on days 1-4 of radiotherapy in week 1. Patients were assessed weekly during treatment. The primary endpoint was dysphagia relief (defined as {$\geq$}1 point reduction on the Mellow scale at 9 weeks and maintained 4 weeks later), and key secondary endpoints were dysphagia progression-free survival (defined as a worsening of at least 1 point on the Mellow scale from baseline or best response) and overall survival. These endpoints were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00193882. This trial is closed. FINDINGS: Between July 7, 2003, and March 21, 2012, 111 patients were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy and 109 patients to radiotherapy. One patient in the chemoradiotherapy group was omitted from analysis because of ineligibility. 50 (45\%, 95\% CI 36-55) patients in the chemoradiotherapy group and 38 (35\%, 26-44) in the radiotherapy group obtained dysphagia relief (difference 10{$\cdot$}6\%, 95\% CI -2 to 23; p=0{$\cdot$}13). Median dysphagia progression-free survival was 4{$\cdot$}1 months (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}5-4{$\cdot$}8) versus 3{$\cdot$}4 months (3{$\cdot$}1-4{$\cdot$}3) in the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups, respectively (p=0{$\cdot$}58), and median overall survival was 6{$\cdot$}9 months (95\% CI 5{$\cdot$}1-8{$\cdot$}3) versus 6{$\cdot$}7 months (4{$\cdot$}9-8{$\cdot$}0), respectively (p=0{$\cdot$}88). Of the 211 patients who commenced radiotherapy, grade 3-4 acute toxicity occurred in 38 (36\%) patients in the chemoradiotherapy group and in 17 (16\%) patients in the radiotherapy group (p=0{$\cdot$}0017). Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, oesophagitis, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and mucositis were significantly worse in patients who had chemoradiotherapy than in patients who had radiotherapy. INTERPRETATION: Palliative chemoradiotherapy showed a modest, but not statistically significant, increase in dysphagia relief compared with radiotherapy alone, with minimal improvement in dysphagia progression-free survival and overall survival with chemoradiotherapy but at a cost of increased toxicity. A short course of radiotherapy alone should be considered a safe and well tolerated treatment for malignant dysphagia in the palliative setting.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Barrett esophagus containing low-grade dysplasia is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, a cancer with a rapidly increasing incidence in the western world. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether endoscopic radiofrequency ablation could decrease the rate of neoplastic progression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter randomized clinical trial that enrolled 136 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Barrett esophagus containing low-grade dysplasia at 9 European sites between June 2007 and June 2011. Patient follow-up ended May 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either endoscopic treatment with radiofrequency ablation (ablation) or endoscopic surveillance (control). Ablation was performed with the balloon device for circumferential ablation of the esophagus or the focal device for targeted ablation, with a maximum of 5 sessions allowed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was neoplastic progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma during a 3-year follow-up since randomization. Secondary outcomes were complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and adverse events. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive ablation and 68 to receive control. Ablation reduced the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma by 25.0\% (1.5\% for ablation vs 26.5\% for control; 95\% CI, 14.1\%-35.9\%; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and the risk of progression to adenocarcinoma by 7.4\% (1.5\% for ablation vs 8.8\% for control; 95\% CI, 0\%-14.7\%; P\,=\,.03). Among patients in the ablation group, complete eradication occurred in 92.6\% for dysplasia and 88.2\% for intestinal metaplasia compared with 27.9\% for dysplasia and 0.0\% for intestinal metaplasia among patients in the control group (P\,{$<$}\,.001). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19.1\% of patients receiving ablation (P\,{$<$}\,.001). The most common adverse event was stricture, occurring in 8 patients receiving ablation (11.8\%), all resolved by endoscopic dilation (median, 1 session). The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the trial due to superiority of ablation for the primary outcome and the potential for patient safety issues if the trial continued. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized trial of patients with Barrett esophagus and a confirmed diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia, radiofrequency ablation resulted in a reduced risk of neoplastic progression over 3 years of follow-up.

These multi-modal protocols have been also introduced to oesophageal cancer surgery. This review aimed to evaluate current literature on ERAS in oesophageal cancer surgery and conduct a meta-analysis on primary and secondary outcomes. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library were searched for eligible studies. We analyzed data up to May 2016. Eligible studies had to contain four described ERAS protocol elements. The primary outcome was overall morbidity. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, specific complications, mortality and readmissions. Random effect meta-analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Initial search yielded 1,064 articles. Thorough evaluation resulted in 13 eligible articles which were analyzed. A total of 2,042 patients were included in the analysis (1,058 ERAS group and 984 treated with traditional protocols). Analysis of overall morbidity as well as complication rate did not show any significant reduction. Non-surgical complications and pulmonary complications were significantly lower in the ERAS group, RR = 0.71 95\% CI 0.62-0.80, p {$<$} 0.00001 and RR = 0.75, 95\% CI 0.60-0.94, p = 0.01, respectively.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the immediate influence of chest tube removal on chest pain and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) after pulmonary resection. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal investigation on 104 consecutive patients (53 wedge/segmentectomies and 51 lobectomies; 69 muscle and nerve-sparing lateral thoracotomy and 35 video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)). Post-operative chest pain was controlled in all patients by a standardized combination of oral and intravenous non-opioid analgesics. All patients had one chest tube (24 French). Static and dynamic (after forced expiratory effort) pain and FEV1 were assessed before and 1 h after the chest tube removal by the same operator. No additional analgesics were administered before or after the chest tube removal. The pain level was assessed by the numeric pain scale [range: 0 (no pain)-10 (excruciating pain)]. FEV1 was assessed by a portable spirometer. Bronchodilators were not used in these patients. Pre- and post-removal measurements were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: The average pre-removal static and dynamic pain scores were 2.6 and 4.1, respectively. The static and dynamic pain scores decreased by 42 and 41\%, respectively, after the tube removal (P {$<$} 0.0001). The average FEV1 before the chest tube removal was 1.5 l or 53\% of the predicted value and increased by 13\% after the tube removal (P = 0.0004). In total, 56 and 78\% of patients reported static and dynamic pain scores improvement and 67\% showed an FEV1 improvement after the chest tube removal. Similar results were observed in patients operated on through VATS or thoracotomy. Compared with patients whose chest tube was removed later, those who had their chest tube removed before post operative day 3 (POD3), showed a greater reduction in the static pain score (41 vs. 31\%, P = 0.05) and greater improvement in FEV1 (18 vs. 0.01\%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The removal of a chest tube reduces pain and improves ventilatory function, independent of surgical access and particularly in the early post-operative phase. A fast track chest tube removal policy may favour patients' recovery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is becoming accepted as an established treatment for superficial esophageal squamous cell neoplasia, the majority of data on this endoscopic modality has been provided by Japanese series. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of ESD for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia in a consecutive series of patients treated in a Western setting. DESIGN AND SETTING: Single-center, prospective observational study. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: From January 2005 to July 2008, 20 patients with superficial esophageal squamous cell neoplasia were treated by ESD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Rates of en bloc resection, complete resection, and complications were evaluated as short-term outcomes. Overall survival, local or distant recurrence, and postoperative stricture rates were evaluated as long-term outcomes. RESULTS: ESD was performed in 20 patients (mean age 64 years, range 46-81 years; 16 men). The mean size of the lesion was 32 mm (range 15-60 mm); it was 30 mm or larger in 14 patients (70\%). The mean time of ESD was 89 minutes (range 58-180 minutes). En bloc resection with resection-free margins was achieved in 18 patients (90\%), whereas 2 patients presented with incomplete or indeterminate resection. Two cases (10\%) of mediastinal emphysema without overt perforation and 1 case (5\%) of post-ESD symptomatic stricture were reported. No local or distant post-ESD recurrence occurred in those with resection-free margins at a median follow-up of 18 months. LIMITATIONS: Small number of patients and limited follow-up. CONCLUSION: This Western series study confirms that ESD is a potentially curative treatment for superficial esophageal squamous cell neoplasia. Early and late complication rates were comparable to those of Japanese series. ESD should be probably considered as the treatment of choice in all large lesions amenable to endoscopic treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy is commonly administered to patients with localized disease who have T3-4 esophageal disease as staged by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Previously, we noted that patients who present with dysphagia have a higher EUS T stage. We hypothesized that the presence of dysphagia is predictive of EUS T3-4 disease and that staging EUS could be forgone for esophageal cancer patients with dysphagia. METHODS: We performed a prospective, intent-to-treat, single-cohort study in which patients with potentially resectable esophageal cancer completed a standardized four-tier dysphagia score survey. EUS was performed as part of our standard evaluation. To determine whether the presence of dysphagia predicted EUS T3-4 disease, the dysphagia score was compared with EUS T stage. RESULTS: The study enrolled 114 consecutive patients between August 2012 and February 2014: 77\% (88 of 114) received neoadjuvant therapy, 18\% (20 of 114) did not, and 5\% (6 of 114) pursued treatment elsewhere. In total, 70\% (80 of 114) underwent esophagectomy; of these, 54\% (61 of 114) had dysphagia and 46\% (53 of 114) did not. Dysphagia scores were 66\% (40 of 61) grade 1, 25\% (15 of 61) grade 2, and 10\% (6 of 61) grade 3 to 4. Among patients with dysphagia, 89\% (54 of 61) had T3-4 disease by EUS; among those without dysphagia, only 53\% (28 of 53) had T3-4 disease by EUS (p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of dysphagia in patients with esophageal cancer was highly predictive of T3-4 disease by EUS. On the basis of this finding, approximately 50\% of patients currently undergoing staging EUS at our institution could potentially forgo EUS before neoadjuvant therapy. Patients without dysphagia, however, should still undergo EUS.},

METHODS: Four hundred thirteen patients with esophageal cancer who presented to Roswell Park Cancer Institute from 1991 to 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data, perioperative details, and postoperative courses were compared for patients older and younger than 70 years. RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven patients (36\%) were older than 70 years. Risk factors, clinical symptoms, histology, and stage at presentation were equivalent for both age groups. A higher percentage of patients {$<$}70 years were candidates for curative resection. There were no significant differences between groups for estimated blood loss, intraoperative transfusions, length of stay, overall morbidity, or mortality. Only postoperative myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation were increased in the older group. Excluding stage IV disease, there was a significant and similar improvement in median survival after resection for patients both {$<$}70 years and {$>$}70 years. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, esophageal cancer in older patients warrants surgical resection because the benefit to the patient is the same as it is for younger patients, without a significant increase in operative morbidity or mortality.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment guidelines for stage I-III esophageal cancer indicate that management should include surgery in appropriate patients. Variations in utilization of surgery may contribute to racial differences observed in survival. We sought to identify factors associated with racial disparities in surgical resection of esophageal cancer and evaluate associated survival differences. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with stage I-III esophageal cancer from 2004 to 2015 were identified using the National Cancer Database. Matched patient cohorts were created to reduce confounding. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receipt of surgery. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization. RESULTS: A total of 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients evenly distributed across race. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95\% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival.},

  abstract = {The incidence of esophageal cancer has increased steadily in the last decades in the United States. The aim of this paper was to characterize disparities in esophageal cancer treatment in different racial and socioeconomic population groups and compare long-term survival among different treatment modalities. A retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database was performed including adult patients ({$\geq$}18 years old) with a diagnosis of resectable (stages I-III) esophageal cancer between 2004 and 2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. In conclusion, underserved patients with esophageal cancer appear to have limited access to surgical care, and are, in fact, more likely to not be offered any treatment at all. Considering the survival benefits associated with surgical resection, greater public health efforts to reduce disparities in esophageal cancer are needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus, a condition of intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus, is associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. We assessed whether endoscopic radiofrequency ablation could eradicate dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and decrease the rate of neoplastic progression. METHODS: In a multicenter, sham-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 127 patients with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus in a 2:1 ratio to receive either radiofrequency ablation (ablation group) or a sham procedure (control group). Randomization was stratified according to the grade of dysplasia and the length of Barrett's esophagus. Primary outcomes at 12 months included the complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analyses, among patients with low-grade dysplasia, complete eradication of dysplasia occurred in 90.5\% of those in the ablation group, as compared with 22.7\% of those in the control group (P{$<$}0.001). Among patients with high-grade dysplasia, complete eradication occurred in 81.0\% of those in the ablation group, as compared with 19.0\% of those in the control group (P{$<$}0.001). Overall, 77.4\% of patients in the ablation group had complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia, as compared with 2.3\% of those in the control group (P{$<$}0.001). Patients in the ablation group had less disease progression (3.6\% vs. 16.3\%, P=0.03) and fewer cancers (1.2\% vs. 9.3\%, P=0.045). Patients reported having more chest pain after the ablation procedure than after the sham procedure. In the ablation group, one patient had upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and five patients (6.0\%) had esophageal stricture. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, radiofrequency ablation was associated with a high rate of complete eradication of both dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and a reduced risk of disease progression.

In this document, the American College of Gastroenterology updates its guidance for the best practices in caring for these patients. These guidelines continue to endorse screening of high-risk patients for BE; however, routine screening is limited to men with reflux symptoms and multiple other risk factors. Acknowledging recent data on the low risk of malignant progression in patients with nondysplastic BE, endoscopic surveillance intervals are attenuated in this population; patients with nondysplastic BE should undergo endoscopic surveillance no more frequently than every 3-5 years. Neither routine use of biomarker panels nor advanced endoscopic imaging techniques (beyond high-definition endoscopy) is recommended at this time. Endoscopic ablative therapy is recommended for patients with BE and high-grade dysplasia, as well as T1a esophageal adenocarcinoma. Based on recent level 1 evidence, endoscopic ablative therapy is also recommended for patients with BE and low-grade dysplasia, although endoscopic surveillance continues to be an acceptable alternative. Given the relatively common recurrence of BE after ablation, we suggest postablation endoscopic surveillance intervals. Although many of the recommendations provided are based on weak evidence or expert opinion, this document provides a pragmatic framework for the care of the patient with BE.},

  abstract = {These recommendations provide an evidence-based approach to the role of esophageal stents in the management of benign and malignant diseases. These guidelines have been developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. The following guidelines are based on a critical review of the available scientific literature on the topic identified in Medline and PubMed (January 1992-December 2008) using search terms that included stents, self-expandable metal stents, self-expandable plastic stents, esophageal cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal stricture, perforations, anastomotic leaks, tracheoesophageal fistula, and achalasia. These guidelines are intended for use by health-care providers and apply to adult, but not pediatric, patients. As with other practice guidelines, these guidelines are not intended to replace clinical judgment but rather to provide general guidelines applicable to the majority of patients. Clinicians need to integrate recommendations with their own clinical judgment, and with individual patient circumstances, values, and preferences. They are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies designed to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations have been assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, which is a system that has been adopted by multiple national and international societies. The GRADE system is based on a sequential assessment of quality of evidence, followed by assessment of the balance between benefits vs. downsides (harms, burden, and costs) and subsequent judgment regarding the strength of recommendation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has been advantageous for lowering pulmonary complications compared with open approaches.(1) However, pulmonary complications remain the most common morbidity after surgical resection of esophageal cancer.(2,3) The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial was designed to see whether low tidal volume (VT) could further minimize pulmonary complications after MIE. METHODS: Between June 2011 and July 2012, a total of 101 patients who underwent MIE received left-lung ventilation during thoracoscopic esophagectomy. All patients received left-lung ventilation during thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to a low VT (5 mL/kg + 5 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure) preserved ventilation (PV) group (n~=~53) and a conventional VT (8 mL/kg) controlled ventilation (CV) group (n~=~48) in the thoracic stage. Alveolar lavage fluid was harvested from the ventilated lung at intubation and at 18 hours after surgery for analysis of interleukin (IL)-1\ss, IL-6, and IL-8 levels. Clinical characteristics, including patient demographics, operation features, and changes in oxygenation index, were recorded and analyzed. Pulmonary complications were identified and statistically compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics and operation features were comparable between the 2 groups. IL-1\ss, IL-6, and IL-8 expressions in preoperative alveolar lavage fluid were similar between the 2 groups. Significantly lower~IL expressions were observed in the PV group than those in the CV group at 18 hours after MIE (IL-1\ss, 25.42 {$\pm$} 31.01 vs 94.96 {$\pm$} 118.24 pg/mL; IL-6, 30.86 {$\pm$} 75.78 vs 92.99 {$\pm$} 72.90 pg/mL; IL-8, 258.75~{$\pm$} 188.24 vs 403.95 {$\pm$} 151.44 pg/mL; all P~{$<~$}.05). The 18-hour postoperative oxygenation index was lower in the CV group than that in the PV group (292.85 {$\pm$} 28.74 vs 326.35 {$\pm$} 34.43; P~=~.046). Pulmonary complications were observed in 18 cases of our series, occurring more frequently on the ventilation side (right, 6 cases; and left, 12 cases). All patients were cured by conservative therapy without severe sequelae. The~occurrence of pulmonary complications in the PV group was lower than that in the CV group (9.43\%~vs~27.08\%; P~=~.021). CONCLUSIONS: Lung injury due to intraoperative single-lung ventilation may contribute to pulmonary complications after MIE. Low VT ventilation could decrease ventilation-associated lung inflammation, thus minimizing pulmonary complications after MIE. Further studies, based on a larger volume of populations, are required to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The border between the esophagus and stomach gives rise to many discrepancies in the current literature regarding the etiology, classification and surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma arising at the esophago-gastric junction. We have consequently used the AEG-criteria (adenocarcinoma of the esophago-gastric junction) for classification and have based the selection of the surgical approach on the anatomic topographic subclassification. METHODS: In the following we report an analysis of a large and homogeneously classified population of 1602 consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophago-gastric junction, with an emphasis on the surgical approach, the pattern of lymphatic spread, the outcome after surgical treatment and the prognostic factors. Demographic data, morphologic and histopathologic tumor characteristics, and long-term survival rates were compared among the three tumor subclassifiations. RESULTS: The study confirms the marked differences in sex distribution, associated specialized intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus, tumor grading, tumor growth pattern, lymphatic spread, and stage between the three tumor entities. The degree of resection and lymph node status were the dominating independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis. The data show no significant differences of long-term survival after abdomino-thoracic esophagectomy and extended total gastrectomy in these patients. CONCLUSION: The classification of adenocarcinomas of the esophago-gastric junction in three types, AEG type I, type II and type III shows marked differences between the tumor entities and is recommended for selection of a proper surgical approach. Complete tumor resection and adequate lymphadenectomy are associated with good long-term prognosis. Better surgical management and standardized procedures will improve the outcome also of patients who need to undergo more radical surgery, i.e. abdomino-thoracic esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous meta-analysis, we identified a survival benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy before surgery in patients with resectable oesophageal carcinoma. We updated this meta-analysis with results from new or updated randomised trials presented in the past 3 years. We also compared the benefits of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: To identify additional studies and published abstracts from major scientific meetings, we searched Medline, Embase, and Central (Cochrane clinical trials database) for studies published since January, 2006, and also manually searched for abstracts from major conferences from the same period. Only randomised studies analysed by intention to treat were included, and searches were restricted to those databases citing articles in English. We used published hazard ratios (HRs) if available or estimates from other survival data. We also investigated treatment effects by tumour histology and relations between risk (survival after surgery alone) and effect size. FINDINGS: We included all 17 trials from the previous meta-analysis and seven further studies. 12 were randomised comparisons of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus surgery alone (n=1854), nine were randomised comparisons of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery alone (n=1981), and two compared neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=194) in patients with resectable oesophageal carcinoma; one factorial trial included two comparisons and was included in analyses of both neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (n=78) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=81). The updated analysis contained 4188 patients whereas the previous publication included 2933 patients. This updated meta-analysis contains about 3500 events compared with about 2230 in the previous meta-analysis (estimated 57\% increase). The HR for all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was 0.78 (95\% CI 0.70-0.88; p{$<$}0.0001); the HR for squamous-cell carcinoma only was 0.80 (0.68-0.93; p=0.004) and for adenocarcinoma only was 0.75 (0.59-0.95; p=0.02). The HR for all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 0.87 (0.79-0.96; p=0.005); the HR for squamous-cell carcinoma only was 0.92 (0.81-1.04; p=0.18) and for adenocarcinoma only was 0.83 (0.71-0.95; p=0.01). The HR for the overall indirect comparison of all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 0.88 (0.76-1.01; p=0.07). INTERPRETATION: This updated meta-analysis provides strong evidence for a survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy over surgery alone in patients with oesophageal carcinoma. A clear advantage of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy over neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been established. These results should help inform decisions about patient management and design of future trials. FUNDING: Cancer Australia and the NSW Cancer Institute.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study compared survival after initial treatment with esophagectomy as primary therapy to induction therapy followed by esophagectomy for patients with clinical T2N0 (cT2N0) esophageal cancer in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). METHODS: Predictors of therapy selection for patients with cT2N0 esophageal cancer in the NCDB from 1998 to 2011 were identified with multivariable logistic regression. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods. RESULTS: Surgery was used in 42.9\% (2057 of 4799) of cT2N0 patients. Of 1599 esophagectomy patients for whom treatment timing was recorded, induction therapy was used in 44.1\% (688). Pretreatment staging was proven accurate in only 26.7\% of patients (210 of 786) who underwent initial surgery without induction treatment and had complete pathologic data available: 41.6\% (n = 327) were upstaged and 31.7\% (n = 249) were downstaged. Adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiation therapy) was given to 50.2\% of patients treated initially with surgery who were found after resection to have nodal disease. There was no significant difference in long-term survival between strategies of primary surgery and induction therapy followed by surgery (median 41.1 versus 41.9 months, p = 0.51). In multivariable analysis, induction therapy was not independently associated with risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16, p = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical staging for early-stage esophageal cancer is highly inaccurate, with only a quarter of surgically resected cT2N0 patients found to have had accurate pretreatment staging. Induction therapy for patients with cT2N0 esophageal cancer in the NCDB is not associated with improved survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health affect diagnosis and delivery of care to patients with esophageal cancer. This study hypothesized that hospital safety-net burden affects presentation, treatment, and outcomes in patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with esophageal cancer (2004 to 2013). Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival using {$\chi$}2 analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and multivariable modeling. RESULTS: There were 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95\% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p~= 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p~= 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Further analysis of unadjusted variables such as performance status, completion of therapy, and continuity of care, and others should be undertaken among safety-net hospitals with the goal of creating appropriate clinical pathways for care of esophageal cancer in vulnerable populations.},

This article is reporting long-term results of this phase III study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinomas of the oesophagogastric junction (Siewert types I-III) were eligible. Randomisation was done to chemotherapy (group A) or induction chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy (CRT; group B) followed by surgery. RESULTS: The primary end-point of the study was overall survival at 3 years. The study was closed early after 119 patients having been randomised and were eligible. Local progression-free survival after tumour resection was significantly improved by CRT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37; 0.16-0.85, p~=~value 0.01) and 20 versus 12 patients were free of local tumour progression at 5 years (p~=~0.03). Although the rate of postoperative in-hospital mortality was somewhat higher with CRT (10.2\% versus 3.8\%, p~=~0.26), more patients were alive at 3 and 5 years after CRT (46.7\% and 39.5\%) compared with chemotherapy (26.1\% and 24.4\%). Thus, overall survival showed a trend in favour of preoperative CRT (HR 0.65, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.01, p~=~0.055). CONCLUSION: Although the primary end-point overall survival of the study was not met, our long-term follow-up data suggest a benefit in local progression-free survival when radiotherapy was added to preoperative chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction.},

The value of adding surgery to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were randomly allocated to either induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (arm A), or the same induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (at least 65 Gy) without surgery (arm B). Primary outcome was overall survival time. RESULTS: The median observation time was 6 years. The analysis of 172 eligible, randomized patients (86 patients per arm) showed overall survival to be equivalent between the two treatment groups (log-rank test for equivalence, P {$<$} .05). Local progression-free survival was better in the surgery group (2-year progression-free survival, 64.3\%; 95\% CI, 52.1\% to 76.5\%) than in the chemoradiotherapy group (2-year progression-free survival, 40.7\%; 95\% CI, 28.9\% to 52.5\%; hazard ratio [HR] for arm B v arm A, 2.1; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 3.5; P = .003). Treatment-related mortality was significantly increased in the surgery group than in the chemoradiotherapy group (12.8\% v 3.5\%, respectively; P = .03). Cox regression analysis revealed clinical tumor response to induction chemotherapy to be the single independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.19 to 0.47; P {$<$} .0001). CONCLUSION: Adding surgery to chemoradiotherapy improves local tumor control but does not increase survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal SCC. Tumor response to induction chemotherapy identifies a favorable prognostic group within these high-risk patients, regardless of the treatment group.},

Adding radiation therapy to preoperative chemotherapy appears promising, but its definitive value remains unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced (uT3-4NXM0) adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus or gastric cardia were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: induction chemotherapy (15 weeks) followed by surgery (arm A); or chemotherapy (12 weeks) followed by chemoradiotherapy (3 weeks) followed by surgery (arm B). Primary outcome was overall survival time. A total of 354 patients were needed to detect a 10\% increase in 3-year survival from 25\% to 35\% by addition of radiation therapy. The study was prematurely closed due to low accrual. RESULTS: The median observation time was 46 months. A total of 126 patients were randomly assigned and 119 eligible patients were evaluated. The number of patients undergoing complete tumor resection was not different between treatment groups (69.5\% v 71.5\%). Patients in arm B had a significant higher probability of showing pathologic complete response (15.6\% v 2.0\%) or tumor-free lymph nodes (64.4\% v 37.7\%) at resection. Preoperative radiation therapy improved 3-year survival rate from 27.7\% to 47.4\% (log-rank P = .07, hazard ratio adjusted for randomization strata variables 0.67, 95\% CI, 0.41 to 1.07). Postoperative mortality was nonsignificantly increased in the chemoradiotherapy group (10.2\% v 3.8\%; P = .26). CONCLUSION: Although the study was closed early and statistical significance was not achieved, results point to a survival advantage for preoperative chemoradiotherapy compared with preoperative chemotherapy in adenocarcinomas of the esophagogastric junction.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) who are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy [BMT]) experience frequent relapses. In a large cohort, we assessed the timing, frequency, and types of relapses during an aggressive surveillance program and the value of the salvage strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with EC (N = 276) who received BMT were analyzed. Patients who had surgery within 6 months of chemoradiotherapy were excluded to reduce bias. We focused on local relapse (LR) and distant metastases (DM) and the salvage treatment of patients with LR only. Standard statistical methods were applied. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (95\% CI, 48.4 to 62.4). First relapses included LR only in 23.2\% (n = 64), DM with or without LR in 43.5\% (n = 120), and no relapses in 33.3\% (n = 92) of patients. Final relapses included no relapses in 33.3\%, LR only in 14.5\%, DM only in 15.9\%, and DM plus LR in 36.2\% of patients. Ninety-one percent of LRs occurred within 2 years and 98\% occurred within 3 years of BMT. Twenty-three (36\%) of 64 patients with LR only underwent salvage surgery, and their median overall survival was 58.6 months (95\% CI, 28.8 to not reached) compared with those patients with LR only who were unable to undergo surgery (9.5 months; 95\% CI, 7.8 to 13.3). CONCLUSION: Unlike in patients undergoing trimodality therapy, for whom surveillance/salvage treatment plays a lesser role,(1) in the BMT population, approximately 8\% of all patients (or 36\% of patients with LR only) with LRs occurring more than 6 months after chemoradiotherapy can undergo salvage treatment, and their survival is excellent. Our data support vigilant surveillance, at least in the first 24 months after chemotherapy, in these patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The primary purpose of surveillance of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and/or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma after local therapy (eg, chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery or trimodality therapy [TMT]) is to implement a potentially beneficial salvage therapy to overcome possible morbidity/mortality caused by locoregional failure (LRF). However, the benefits of surveillance are not well understood. We report on LRFs and salvage strategies in a large cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2010, 518 patients with EAC who completed TMT were analyzed for the frequency of LRF over time and salvage therapy outcomes. Standard statistical techniques were used. RESULTS: For 518 patients, the median follow-up time was 29.3 months (range, 1 to 149 months). Distant metastases (with or without LRF) occurred in 188 patients (36\%), and LRF only occurred in 27 patients (5\%). Eleven of 27 patients had lumen-only LRF. Most LRFs (89\%) occurred within 36 months of surgery. Twelve patients had salvage chemoradiotherapy, but only five survived more than 2 years. Four patients needed salvage surgery, and three who survived more than 2 years developed distant metastases. The median overall survival of 27 patients with LRF was 17 months, and 10 patients (37\%) survived more than 2 years. Thus, only 2\% of all 518 patients benefited from surveillance/salvage strategies. CONCLUSION: Our surveillance strategy, which is representative of many others currently being used, raises doubts about its effectiveness and benefits (along with concerns regarding types and times of studies and costs implications) to patients with EAC who have LRF only after TMT. Fortunately, LRFs are rare after TMT, but the salvage strategies are not highly beneficial. Our data can help develop an evidence-based surveillance strategy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessment of preoperative physiological status is crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for esophageal carcinoma (EC). We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of pulmonary dysfunctions and their relationships with other physiological factors, especially sarcopenia, in EC patients receiving esophagectomy. METHODS: In total, 411 EC patients who underwent esophagectomy between 2006 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative pulmonary functions were evaluated based on \%vital capacity (\%VC) and forced expiratory volume (FEV) 1.0\%. The thresholds were set as the lowest quartile (99\% for \%VC and 68.6\% for FEV1.0\%) in this cohort. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients (24.8\%) had low \%VC (\%VC\,{$<$}\,99\%), which was significantly associated with age, comorbidity, sarcopenia and postoperative complications, while not correlating with pathological variables. The overall survival (OS) of patients in the low \%VC group was significantly poorer than that of those in the high \%VC group (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), especially in those with pStage 0-II diseases (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). In contrast, survival was not stratified by FEV1.0\% (P\,=\,0.80). Notably, patients with both low \%VC and sarcopenia showed very poor 5-year OS (30.3\%). Multivariate analysis revealed low \%VC to be independently associated with poor OS (P\,=\,0.03). In the cause-specific survival analyses, low \%VC was an independent predictor of deaths from non-EC-related causes (P\,=\,0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative low \%VC was independently associated with poor survival outcomes, especially when present in combination with sarcopenia, due to an increased risk of death from non-EC-related causes. Preoperative spirometry testing is useful for predicting long-term outcomes in EC patients undergoing esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the utility of positron emission tomography (PET), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and computed tomographic (CT) scans to predict pathologic response and survival following preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) in esophageal cancer. METHODS: One hundred three sequential patients with locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer, who were treated with CRT and esophageal resection between May 2001 and November 2003 at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, were retrospectively reviewed. PET, EUS, and CT were performed before (pre) or after (post) CRT and before surgical resection. PET standardized uptake value (SUV) was defined as maximal uptake in primary tumor. RESULTS: Most patients were male (91 [88\%]) with adenocarcinoma (90 [87\%]). Pretreatment clinical stages were: IIA (42 [41\%]), IIB (5 [5\%]), III (50 [49\%]), and IVA (6 [6\%]). At the time of surgery, 58 patients (56\%) had a pathologic response to CRT ({$<$} or =10\% viable cells). Post-CRT measurements that correlated with pathologic response were: CT esophageal wall thickness (13.3 vs 15.3 mm, p = 0.04), EUS mass size (0.7 vs 1.7 cm, p = 0.01) and PET SUV (3.1 vs 5.8, p = 0.01). Post-CRT PET SUV equal to or greater than 4 had the highest accuracy for pathologic response (76\%). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that a post-CRT PET SUV equal to or greater than 4 was an independent predictor of survival (HR, 3.5, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The FDG-PET SUV is the most accurate noninvasive test to predict long-term survival after preoperative CRT and before surgical resection. Post-CRT FDG-PET cannot, however, rule out residual microscopic disease so esophagectomy should remain a therapeutic option even if the post-CRT imaging modalities are normal.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Some patients and oncologists choose to treat localized esophageal cancer with definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy rather than surgery. A subset of these patients have local relapse without distant metastases and therefore have no other curative intent treatment option but salvage esophagectomy. METHODS: We reviewed our experience with salvage esophagectomy from 1987 to 2000 at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (n = 13, salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group) and compared the data with those of patients receiving esophagectomy in a planned fashion 4 to 6 weeks after preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy (n = 99, preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group). RESULTS: Increases in morbidity were seen after resection in the salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group relative to the preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group: mechanical ventilation (9.0 days vs 3.3 days, P =.08), intensive care unit stay (11.2 days vs 5.1 days, P =.07), hospital stay (29.4 days vs 18.4 days, P =.03), and anastomotic leak rates (5/13 [39\%] vs 7/99 [7\%], P =.005). Operative mortality (within 30 days) also tended to be increased statistically nonsignificantly (2/13 [15\%] vs 6/99 [6\%], P =.2). Salvage esophagectomy resulted in long-term survival (25\% 5-year survival) in a subset of patients. Improved survival after salvage esophagectomy was associated with early pathologic stage (T1 N0, T2 N0), prolonged time to relapse, and R0 surgical resection. CONCLUSION: Patients who undergo salvage esophagectomy for relapse of tumor after definitive chemoradiation therapy have increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital use relative to patients undergoing planned esophagectomy after preoperative chemoradiation. Nevertheless, long-term survival can be achieved in this group, and such treatment should be considered for carefully selected patients at an experienced center.},

METHODS: The exposure in this study of patients age 18-80 with one of nine non-advanced stage GI cancers in the 2007-2015 SEER database was a census tract-level SES composite. Multivariable models assessed associations of SES with use of surgery. Causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the proportion of survival disparities in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 that were mediated by disparities in use of surgery. RESULTS: Lowest SES quintile patients underwent surgery at significantly lower rates than highest quintile patients in each cancer. SES-based disparities in use of surgery were large and graded in esophagus adenocarcinoma, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Smaller but clinically relevant disparities were present in stomach, ampulla, and small bowel adenocarcinoma, whereas disparities were small in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Five-year all-stage overall survival (OS) was correlated with the size of disparities in use of surgery in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 (r\,=\,-\,0.87; p\,=\,0.003). Mean OS was significantly longer (range 3.5-8.9~months) in SES quintile 5 versus 1. Approximately one third of SES-based survival disparities in poor prognosis GI cancers were mediated by disparities in use of surgery. The size of disparities in use of surgery in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 was correlated with the proportion mediated (r\,=\,0.98; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low SES patients with poor prognosis GI cancers are at substantial risk of undertreatment. Disparities in use of surgery contribute to diminished survival.},

The rate of weight loss at postoperative day (POD) 14, levels of prealbumin at POD 10, postoperative complications until POD 14, and other perioperative data were collected for each group. RESULTS: This study analyzed data for 47 patients. The rate of weight loss at POD 14 was significantly lower in the EN group (3.0 {$\pm$} 3.2 \%) than in the PN group (5.1 {$\pm$} 3.7 \%; p = 0.020). Prealbumin levels were 21.0 {$\pm$} 7.5 mg/dL in the PN group and 18.4 {$\pm$} 5.8 mg/dL in the EN group at POD 10, with no significant differences between the groups. However, the incidence of postoperative pneumonia was higher in the PN group (30.4 \%) than in the EN group (12.5 \%). CONCLUSIONS: EN could suppress weight loss and reduce the incidence of pneumonia after thoracoscopic esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {Current algorithms for surveillance of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) after chemoradiation and surgery (trimodality therapy [TMT]) remain empiric. The authors hypothesized that the frequency, type, and timing of relapses after TMT would be highly associated with surgical pathology stage (SPS), and therefore SPS could be used to individualize the surveillance strategy. Between 2000 and 2010, 518 patients with EAC were identified who underwent TMT at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and were frequently surveyed. Frequency, type, and timing of the first relapse (locoregional and/or distant) were tabulated according to SPS. Standard statistical approaches were used. The median follow-up time after esophageal surgery was 55.4 months (range, 1.0-149.2 months). Disease relapse occurred in 215 patients (41.5\%). Higher SPS was associated with a higher rate of relapse (0/I vs II/III, P{$\leq$}.001; 0/I vs II, P=.002; SPS 0/I vs III, P{$\leq$}.001; and SPS II vs III, P=.005) and with shorter time to relapse (P{$<$}.001). Irrespective of the SPS, approximately 95\% of all relapses occurred within 36 months of surgery. The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were shorter for patients with a higher SPS than those with a lower SPS (0/I vs II/III, P{$\leq$}.001; 0/I vs II, P{$\leq$}.001; 0/I vs III, P{$\leq$}.001; and II vs III, P=.014). The compelling data show an excellent association between SPS and frequency/type/timing of relapses after TMT in patients with EAC. Thus, the surveillance strategy can potentially be customized based on SPS. These data can inform a future evidence-based surveillance strategy that can be efficient and cost-effective.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For patients with localized esophageal cancer (EC) who can withstand surgery, the preferred therapy is chemoradiation followed by surgery (trimodality). However, after achieving a clinical complete response [clinCR; defined as both post-chemoradiation endoscopic biopsy showing no cancer and physiologic uptake by positron emission tomography (PET)], some patients decline surgery. The literature on the outcome of such patients is sparse. METHOD: Between 2002 and 2011, we identified 622 trimodality-eligible EC patients in our prospectively maintained databases. All patients had to be trimodality eligible and must have completed preoperative staging after chemoradiation that included repeat endoscopic biopsy and PET among other routine tests. RESULTS: Out of 622 trimodality-eligible patients identified, 61 patients (9.8\%) declined surgery. All 61 patients had a clinCR. The median age was 69 years (range 47-85). Males (85.2\%) and Caucasians (88.5\%) were dominant. Baseline stage was II (44.2\%) or III (52.5\%), and histology was adenocarcinoma (65.6\%) or squamous cell carcinoma (29.5\%). Forty-two patients are alive at a median follow-up of 50.9 months (95\% CI 39.5-62.3). The 5-year overall and relapse-free survival rates were 58.1 {$\pm$} 8.4 and 35.3 {$\pm$} 7.6\%, respectively. Of 13 patients with local recurrence during surveillance, 12 had successful salvage resection. CONCLUSION: Although the outcome of 61 EC patients with clinCR who declined surgery appears reasonable, in the absence of a validated prediction/prognosis model, surgery must be encouraged for all trimodality-eligible patients.},

Some patients, however, decline surgery after preoperative chemoradiation. The question of which patient should have esophagectomy and which one should not is unlikely to be answered by a prospective comparison; therefore, we matched the clinical covariates of several patients who had surgery with those who declined surgery (DS). METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, we identified 623 patients in our databases. Of 623 patients, 244 patients had TMT and 61 TMT-eligible patients were in the DS group. Using the propensity-score method, we matched 16 covariates between 36 DS patients and 36 TMT patients. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics between the two groups were balanced (p = NS). The median overall survival times were: 57.9 months (95\% CI: 27.7 to not applicable, NA) for the DS group and 50.8 months (95\% CI: 30.7 to NA) for the TMT group (p = 0.28). The median relapse-free survival times were: 18.5 (95\% CI: 11.5-30.4) for the DS group and 26.5 months (95\% CI: 15.5-NA) for the TMT group (p = 0.45). Eleven (31\%) of 36 patients in the DS group had salvage surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are intriguing but skewed by the patients who had salvage surgery in the DS group. Until highly reliable predictive models are developed for esophageal preservation, TMT must be encouraged for all TMT-eligible gastroesophageal cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Para-aortic lymph node (PALN) recurrence is often seen in patients with lower thoracic esophageal cancer treated by esophagectomy with extended lymph node dissection. However, the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with PALN metastasis and the significance of PALN dissection are unknown. A total of 283 patients with lower thoracic esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy at our hospital between April 1984 and March 2007. Among these 283 patients, 60 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study according to following criteria: (i) clinical T2 to T4 tumor, (ii) no clinical PALN metastasis, and (iii) received PALN dissection. PALN dissection was indicated by a tumor depth of at least T2 and no severe complications. The clinicopathological data, recurrence pattern, and overall survival were compared between patients with PALN and without PALN metastasis. The mean length of surgery was 587 min and the mean blood loss was 1383 mL. The morbidity was 33.3\% and mortality was 5\% in this series. Sixteen patients (26.7\%) had PALN metastasis; these showed significantly more lymph node metastases (15.8 {$\pm$} 13.2 vs. 3.0 {$\pm$} 3.2, P {$<$} 0.0001) and significantly worse survival rates (53.3\% vs. 79.9\% at 1 year, 6.7\% vs. 62.0\% at 3 years, P {$<$} 0.0001) than patients without PALN metastasis. The incidence of lymph node recurrence (P {$<$} 0.0001) and hematogenous recurrence (P= 0.0487) was also higher in patients with PALN metastasis than in patients without PALN metastasis. Among the 16 patients with PALN metastasis, a univariate analysis revealed total number of metastatic nodes {$<$} 8 (P= 0.0325) to be a significant prognostic factor. A multivariate logistic regression analysis of the regional lymph nodes identified the invasion of the lower mediastinal nodes (hazard ratio = 6.120) and retroperitoneal nodes (hazard ratio = 15.167) to be significantly correlated with PALN metastasis. PALN metastasis is suggested to be related to the systemic spread of lymphatic metastasis even in lower thoracic esophageal cancer. PALN dissection for pathological PALN(+) patients should not be performed. It remains to be determined in future prospective studies whether patients without pathological PALN metastasis, but showing PALN micrometastasis, could achieve improved survival with PALN dissection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For endoscopic resection of early GI neoplasia, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) achieves higher rates of complete resection (R0) than endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). However, ESD is technically more difficult and evidence from randomised trial is missing. OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy and safety of ESD and EMR in patients with neoplastic Barrett's oesophagus (BO). DESIGN: BO patients with a focal lesion of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or early adenocarcinoma (EAC) {$\leq$}3\hspace{0.25em}cm were randomised to either ESD or EMR. Primary outcome was R0 resection; secondary outcomes were complete remission from neoplasia, recurrences and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in patient and lesion characteristics between the groups randomised to ESD (n=20) or EMR (n=20). Histology of the resected specimen showed HGIN or EAC in all but six cases. Although R0 resection defined as margins free of HGIN/EAC was achieved more frequently with ESD (10/17 vs 2/17, p=0.01), there was no difference in complete remission from neoplasia at 3\hspace{0.25em}months (ESD 15/16 vs EMR 16/17, p=1.0). During a mean follow-up period of 23.1{$\pm$}6.4\hspace{0.25em}months, recurrent EAC was observed in one case in the ESD group. Elective surgery was performed in four and three cases after ESD and EMR, respectively (p=1.0). Two severe AEs were recorded for ESD and none for EMR (p=0.49). CONCLUSIONS: In terms of need for surgery, neoplasia remission and recurrence, ESD and EMR are both highly effective for endoscopic resection of early BO neoplasia. ESD achieves a higher R0 resection rate, but for most BO patients this bears little clinical relevance. ESD is, however, more time consuming and may cause severe AE.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromoendoscopy is traditionally used to identify inconspicuous Barrett's neoplasia and mark the boundaries before endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Trimodal imaging endoscopy is useful in identifying early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy (lateral and deep margin clearance) of trimodal imaging endoscopy-assisted EMR in early Barrett's neoplasia in a tertiary referral setting. METHODS: The entire Barrett's segment was visualized by high-resolution endoscopy followed by autofluorescence imaging, and suspicious areas were identified. Narrow band imaging and magnification was used to confirm the suspicious areas. The outer boundary of the lesion was then marked using the tip of a snare diathermy and EMR was performed using multiband mucosectomy technique by a single operator (KR). RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included: 13 patients had high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN); 3 patients had intramucosal carcinoma (IMC); (8 males, median age, 69.5 (range, 50-77) years with Barrett's esophagus (interquartile range (IQR), 2-5 cm; median length, 3 cm). All lesions were successfully identified, using trimodal imaging endoscopy. Overall EMR was complete in 14 of 16 (81.2\%) patients with early Barrett's neoplasia. Four of 16 patients (18\%; all with pre-EMR HGIN) were considered to have incomplete EMR (deep margins involved), but operative histology showed only Barrett's metaplasia in 2 (histological false positive) and IMC in 1. Thus, overall 14 of 16 (87.5\%) patients had complete EMR of the original lesions. In patients who did not undergo esophagectomy, there was no disease recurrence on endoscopic biopsies at a mean follow-up of 8 (IQR, 6-12) months. Three of the 16 patients (18.75\%) with post-EMR bleeding were successfully treated with APC/hemoclips. CONCLUSIONS: Trimodal imaging endoscopy is a feasible alternative to chromoendoscopy to identify inconspicuous neoplasia and assist EMR of early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus.},

AIMS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to determine whether survival differences among racial/ethnic patient populations persist after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. METHODS: Our study included T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. We compared survival among two racial/ethnic patient subgroups using Cox proportional hazards methods, adjusting for age, sex, histology, marital status, socioeconomics, SEER region, comorbidities, T stage, tumor location, diagnosis year, and treatment received. RESULTS: Among 2025 patients, 87.9\% were White and 12.1\% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7~months for Whites vs 13.8~months for Nonwhites (p\,=\,0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR\,=\,1.29, 95\% CI 1.11-1.49, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR\,=\,0.94, 95\% CI 0.80-1.10, p\,=\,0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors. In particular, associations were seen in surgery and T stage. Further research is needed to understand potential mechanisms underlying the differences and to better target patients who can benefit from treatment options.},

In this study, we analyzed the independent effects of race, gender, treatment, and socioeconomic status (SES) on overall survival (OS). METHODS: Data for all EC cases between 2004 and 2010 with follow-up through 2012 were obtained from the California Cancer Registry. We conducted descriptive analyses of clinical variables and survival analyses by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods. RESULTS: African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95\% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Our findings support further health disparities research for this disease.},

METHODS: Medline and manual searches were done (completed independently and in duplicate) to identify all published RCTs that addressed the issue of pyloric drainage procedures during gastric conduit reconstruction of the esophagus. The selection process was inclusive; no trials were excluded. Trial validity assessment was done, and a trial quality score was assigned. Early outcomes assessed by meta-analysis included operative mortality, esophagogastric anastomotic leaks, pulmonary morbidity, pyloric drainage complications, fatal pulmonary aspiration, and gastric outlet obstruction. A random-effects model was used, and the relative risk was the principal measure of effect. Systematic semiquantitative review was used for late outcomes such as gastric emptying, bile reflux, nutritional status, and obstructive foregut symptoms. RESULTS: Nine RCTs, that included a total of 553 patients, were selected, with quality scores ranging from 1 to 4 (5-point Jadad scale). Selection and validity agreement was strong. The relative risk (95\% CI; p value), expressed as pyloric drainage versus no drainage (treatment vs. control), was 0.92 (0.34, 2.44; p = 0.86) for operative mortality, 0.90 (0.47, 1.76; p = 0.77) for esophagogastric anastomotic leaks, 0.69 (0.42, 1.14; p = 0.15) for pulmonary morbidity, 2.55 (0.34, 18.98; p = 0.36) for pyloric drainage complications, 0.25 (0.04, 1.60; p = 0.14) for fatal pulmonary aspiration, and 0.18 (0.03, 0.97; p = 0.046) for gastric outlet obstruction. Systematic semiquantitative review showed a nonsignificant trend favoring pyloric drainage for the late outcomes of gastric emptying, nutritional status, and obstructive foregut symptoms. For the late outcome of bile reflux, there was a nonsignificant trend favoring the no-drainage group. The scintographic gastric emptying time, expressed as a ratio (pyloric drainage/no drainage), was 0.53. CONCLUSIONS: Data synthesized from existing RCTs show that pyloric drainage procedures reduce the occurrence of early postoperative gastric outlet obstruction after esophagectomy with gastric reconstruction, but they have little effect on other early and late patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Palliation of malignant esophageal obstruction is an important clinical problem. Expandable metal stents are a major advance in therapy, but many stents become obstructed because of tumor ingrowth. The aim of this study was to compare a new, membrane-covered expandable metal stent to conventional prostheses in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with malignant inoperable esophageal obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction participated in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to covered or uncovered stents. The principal outcome measure was the need for reintervention because of recurrent dysphagia or migration. Secondary endpoints were relief of dysphagia measured by a dysphagia score (grade 0 = no dysphagia, grade 1 = able to eat solid food, grade 2 = semisolids only, grade 3 = liquids only, grade 4 = complete dysphagia) and the rate of complications and functional status. All patients were observed at monthly intervals until death or for 6 months. RESULTS: One week after stenting the dysphagia score improved significantly in both the uncovered (n = 32, 3 +/- 0.1 to 1 +/- 0.1 [means +/- SEMs], p {$<$} 0.001) and covered (n = 30, 3 +/- 0.1 to 1 +/- 0.2 [means +/- SEMs], p {$<$} 0.001) stents. Obstructing tumor ingrowth was significantly more likely in the uncovered stent group (9/30) than in the covered group (1/32) (p = 0.005). Significant stent migration occurred in 2/30 patients with uncovered stents, as compared with 4/32 patients in the covered group (p = 0.44). Reinterventions for tumor ingrowth were significantly greater in the uncovered stent group (27\%), as compared with 0\% in the covered group (p = 0.002). Life table analysis showed similar survival in both groups. CONCLUSION: Membrane-covered stents have significantly better palliation than conventional bare metal stents because of decreased rates of tumor ingrowth that necessitate endoscopic reintervention for dysphagia.},

  abstract = {Our purpose was to prospectively investigate optimal evaluation of qualitative and quantitative 18F-FDG PET/CT in response evaluations 12-14 wk after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in esophageal cancer patients. Methods: This was a side study of the prospective diagnostic pre-SANO trial. 18F-FDG PET/CT scans at baseline and at 12-14 wk after nCRT were qualitatively assessed for the presence of tumor. Maximum SUVs normalized for lean body mass (SULmax) were measured in all scans. The primary endpoint was the proportion of false-negative patients with tumor regression grade (TRG) 3-4 ({$>$}10\% vital residual tumor) in qualitative and quantitative analyses. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis for TRG1 versus TRG3-4 using SULmax, SULmax tumor-to-esophagus ratio, and {$\Delta\%$}SULmax was performed to define optimal cutoffs. Secondary endpoints were sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for TRG1 versus TRG2-4. Results: In total, 129 of 219 patients were analyzed. Qualitative 18F-FDG PET/CT was unable to detect TRG3-4 in 15\% of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value in qualitative analysis for detecting TRG1 versus TRG2-4 was 80\%, 37\%, 42\%, and 77\%, respectively. In 18 of 190 patients (10\%) with follow-up scans after nCRT, 18F-FDG PET/CT identified new interval metastases. Quantitative parameters did not detect TRG3-4 tumor in 27\%-61\% of patients. The optimal cutoff for detecting TRG1 versus TRG2-4 was a post-nCRT SULmax of 2.93 (area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve, 0.70). Conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative analyses of 18F-FDG PET/CT are unable to accurately detect TRG3-4 and to discriminate substantial residual disease from benign inflammation-induced 18F-FDG uptake after nCRT. However, 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for the detection of interval metastases and might become useful in an active surveillance strategy with serial 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning.},

We hypothesized that patients with esophageal cancer with {$>$}10\% weight loss during the 3 months before their diagnosis would be at an increased risk of postoperative complications, have a longer length of stay, and have worse overall survival. METHODS: In the present hospital-based cohort study, all patients who had undergone surgery for esophageal cancer in 1990 to 2010 at the Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam were included. Weight loss was defined as "no, or limited" ({$\leq$}10\%) or "severe" ({$>$}10\%). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of complications, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Hazard ratios were calculated to assess the length of hospital stay and survival. The risk estimates were adjusted for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Of 922 included patients, 155 (17\%) had experienced severe weight loss. These patients had no increased risk of early surgical, early nonsurgical, or late surgical complications (OR, 0.83 and 95\% CI, 0.54-1.24; OR, 0.90 and 95\% CI, 0.63-1.30; OR, 1.14 and 95\% CI, 0.79-1.66, respectively) and had no increased length of stay (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.89-1.35). Preoperative weight loss was followed by increased 5-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.74).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active surveillance after neoadjuvant therapies has emerged among several malignancies. During active surveillance, frequent assessments are performed to detect residual disease and surgery is only reserved for those patients in whom residual disease is proven or highly suspected without distant metastases. After neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), nearly one-third of esophageal cancer patients achieve a pathologically complete response (pCR). Both patients that achieve a pCR and patients that harbor subclinical disseminated disease after nCRT could benefit from an active surveillance strategy. SUMMARY: Esophagectomy is still the cornerstone of treatment in patients with esophageal cancer. Non-surgical treatment via definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) is currently reserved only for patients not eligible for esophagectomy. Since salvage esophagectomy after dCRT (50-60 Gy) results in increased complications, morbidity and mortality compared to surgery after nCRT (41.4 Gy), the latter seems preferable in the setting of active surveillance. Clinical response evaluations can detect substantial (i.e., tumor regression grade [TRG] 3-4) tumors after nCRT with a sensitivity of 90\%, minimizing the risk of development of non-resectable recurrences. Current scarce and retrospective literature suggests that active surveillance following nCRT might not jeopardize overall survival and postponed surgery could be performed safely. Key Message: Before an active surveillance approach could be considered standard treatment, results of phase III randomized trials should be awaited.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of patients with esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer is not well established. We compared chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery with surgery alone in this patient population. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with resectable tumors to receive surgery alone or weekly administration of carboplatin (doses titrated to achieve an area under the curve of 2 mg per milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) for 5 weeks and concurrent radiotherapy (41.4 Gy in 23 fractions, 5 days per week), followed by surgery. RESULTS: From March 2004 through December 2008, we enrolled 368 patients, 366 of whom were included in the analysis: 275 (75\%) had adenocarcinoma, 84 (23\%) had squamous-cell carcinoma, and 7 (2\%) had large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Of the 366 patients, 178 were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, and 188 to surgery alone. The most common major hematologic toxic effects in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group were leukopenia (6\%) and neutropenia (2\%); the most common major nonhematologic toxic effects were anorexia (5\%) and fatigue (3\%). Complete resection with no tumor within 1 mm of the resection margins (R0) was achieved in 92\% of patients in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 69\% in the surgery group (P{$<$}0.001). A pathological complete response was achieved in 47 of 161 patients (29\%) who underwent resection after chemoradiotherapy. Postoperative complications were similar in the two treatment groups, and in-hospital mortality was 4\% in both. Median overall survival was 49.4 months in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 24.0 months in the surgery group. Overall survival was significantly better in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group (hazard ratio, 0.657; 95\% confidence interval, 0.495 to 0.871; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improved survival among patients with potentially curable esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer.

  abstract = {A reliable prediction of a pathologic complete response (pathCR) to chemoradiotherapy before surgery for esophageal cancer would enable investigators to study the feasibility and outcome of an organ-preserving strategy after chemoradiotherapy. So far no clinical parameters or diagnostic studies are able to accurately predict which patients will achieve a pathCR. The aim of this study was to determine whether subjective and quantitative assessment of baseline and postchemoradiation (18)F-FDG PET can improve the accuracy of predicting pathCR to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer beyond clinical predictors. METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the need for written informed consent was waived. Clinical parameters along with subjective and quantitative parameters from baseline and postchemoradiation (18)F-FDG PET were derived from 217 esophageal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. The associations between these parameters and pathCR were studied in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Four prediction models were constructed and internally validated using bootstrapping to study the incremental predictive values of subjective assessment of (18)F-FDG PET, conventional quantitative metabolic features, and comprehensive (18)F-FDG PET texture/geometry features, respectively. The clinical benefit of (18)F-FDG PET was determined using decision-curve analysis. RESULTS: A pathCR was found in 59 (27\%) patients. A clinical prediction model (corrected c-index, 0.67) was improved by adding (18)F-FDG PET-based subjective assessment of response (corrected c-index, 0.72). This latter model was slightly improved by the addition of 1 conventional quantitative metabolic feature only (i.e., postchemoradiation total lesion glycolysis; corrected c-index, 0.73), and even more by subsequently adding 4 comprehensive (18)F-FDG PET texture/geometry features (corrected c-index, 0.77). However, at a decision threshold of 0.9 or higher, representing a clinically relevant predictive value for pathCR at which one may be willing to omit surgery, there was no clear incremental value. CONCLUSION: Subjective and quantitative assessment of (18)F-FDG PET provides statistical incremental value for predicting pathCR after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer. However, the discriminatory improvement beyond clinical predictors does not translate into a clinically relevant benefit that could change decision making.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic performance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in staging of oesophageal cancer. PubMed was searched to identify English-language articles published before January 2006 and reporting on diagnostic performance of EUS, CT, and/or FDG-PET in oesophageal cancer patients. Articles were included if absolute numbers of true-positive, false-negative, false-positive, and true-negative test results were available or derivable for regional, celiac, and abdominal lymph node metastases and/or distant metastases. Sensitivities and specificities were pooled using a random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to study potential effects of study and patient characteristics. Random effects pooled sensitivities of EUS, CT, and FDG-PET for regional lymph node metastases were 0.80 (95\% confidence interval 0.75-0.84), 0.50 (0.41-0.60), and 0.57 (0.43-0.70), respectively, and specificities were 0.70 (0.65-0.75), 0.83 (0.77-0.89), and 0.85 (0.76-0.95), respectively. Diagnostic performance did not differ significantly across these tests. For detection of celiac lymph node metastases by EUS, sensitivity and specificity were 0.85 (0.72-0.99) and 0.96 (0.92-1.00), respectively. For abdominal lymph node metastases by CT, these values were 0.42 (0.29-0.54) and 0.93 (0.86-1.00), respectively. For distant metastases, sensitivity and specificity were 0.71 (0.62-0.79) and 0.93 (0.89-0.97) for FDG-PET and 0.52 (0.33-0.71) and 0.91 (0.86-0.96) for CT, respectively. Diagnostic performance of FDG-PET for distant metastases was significantly higher than that of CT, which was not significantly affected by study and patient characteristics. The results suggest that EUS, CT, and FDG-PET each play a distinctive role in the detection of metastases in oesophageal cancer patients. For the detection of regional lymph node metastases, EUS is most sensitive, whereas CT and FDG-PET are more specific tests. For the evaluation of distant metastases, FDG-PET has probably a higher sensitivity than CT. Its combined use could however be of clinical value, with FDG-PET detecting possible metastases and CT confirming or excluding their presence and precisely determining the location(s).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Please see Appendix 4 for a glossary of terms.The outcome of patients with esophageal cancer is generally poor. Although multimodal therapy is standard, there is conflicting evidence regarding the addition of esophagectomy to chemoradiotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness and safety of chemoradiotherapy plus surgery with that of chemoradiotherapy alone in people with nonmetastatic esophageal carcinoma. SEARCH METHODS: We performed a computerized search for relevant studies, up to Feburary 2017, on the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases using MeSH headings and keywords. We searched five online databases of clinical trials, handsearched conference proceedings, and screened reference lists of retrieved papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemoradiotherapy plus esophagectomy with chemoradiotherapy alone for localized esophageal carcinoma. We excluded RCTs comparing chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone with esophagectomy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the quality of the evidence, using standardized Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), estimated with Hazard Ratio (HR). Secondary outcomes, estimated with risk ratio (RR), were local and distant progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QoL), treatment-related mortality and morbidity, and use of salvage procedures for dysphagia. Data were analyzed using a random effects model in Review Manager 5.3 software. MAIN RESULTS: From 2667 references, we identified two randomized studies, in six reports, that included 431 participants. All participants were clinically staged to have at least T3 and/or node positive thoracic esophageal carcinoma, 93\% of which was squamous cell histology. The risk of methodological bias of the included studies was low to moderate.High-quality evidence found the addition of esophagectomy had little or no difference on overall survival (HR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.79 to 1.24; P = 0.92; I{$^2$} = 0\%; two trials). Neither study reported PFS, therefore, freedom from loco-regional relapse was used as a proxy. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that the addition of esophagectomy probably improved freedom from locoregional relapse (HR 0.55, 95\% CI 0.39 to 0.76; P = 0.0004; I{$^2$} = 0\%; two trials), but low-quality evidence suggested it may increase the risk of treatment-related mortality (RR 5.11, 95\% CI 1.74 to 15.02; P = 0.003; I{$^2$} = 2\%; two trials).The other pre-specified outcomes (quality of life, treatment-related toxicity, and use of salvage procedures for dysphagia) were reported by only one study, which found very low-quality evidence that use of esophagectomy was associated with reduced short-term QoL (MD 0.93, 95\% CI 0.24 to 1.62), and low-quality evidence that it reduced use of salvage procedures for dysphagia (HR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.36 to 0.75). Neither study compared treatment-related morbidity between treatment groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, the addition of esophagectomy to chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, provides little or no difference on overall survival, and may be associated with higher treatment-related mortality. The addition of esophagectomy probably delays locoregional relapse, however, this end point was not well defined in the included studies. It is undetermined whether these results can be applied to the treatment of adenocarcinomas, tumors involving the distal esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction, and to people with poor response to chemoradiation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To examine the efficacy of the Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal carcinoma prior to the widespread use of preoperative chemotherapy and irradiation, we reviewed our experience. METHODS: We reexamined the cases of 220 consecutive patients who underwent an Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal cancer from January 1992 through December 1995. RESULTS: There were 196 men (89.1\%) and 24 women. Median age was 65 years (range, 29 to 85 years). The results of pathological study showed adenocarcinoma in 188 patients (85.5\%), squamous cell carcinoma in 31 (14.1\%), and leiomyosarcoma in 1 patient (0.5\%). Postsurgical staging was as follows: stage 0 in 10 patients, stage I in 19, stage IIa in 38, stage IIb in 28, stage III in 111, and stage IV in 14. The operative mortality rate was 1.4\% (3 patients), and complications occurred in 83 patients (37.7\%). Follow-up was 98.6\% complete. Median survival for operative survivors was 1.9 years (range, 32 days to 8.7 years). The overall 5-year survival rate was 25.2\%; it was 80\% for patients in stage 0, 94.4\% for those in stage I, 36.0\% for those in stage IIa, 14.3\% for patients in stage IIb, 10\% for those in stage III and 0\% for patients in stage IV. CONCLUSIONS: Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal cancer is a safe operation. Long-term survival is stage dependent. The low survival associated with advanced cancers should stimulate the search for effective neoadjuvant therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standard therapy for loco-regionally advanced, resectable oesophageal carcinoma is trimodality therapy (TMT) consisting of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and oesophagectomy. Evidence of survival advantage of TMT over organ-preserving definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) is inconclusive. The aim of this study is to compare survival between TMT and dCRT. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies on resectable, curatively treated, oesophageal carcinoma patients above 18~years were included. Three online databases were searched for studies comparing TMT with dCRT. Primary outcomes were 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tools for RCTs and cohort studies. Quality of evidence was evaluated according to Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies described in 35 articles were included in this systematic review, and 33 were included in the meta-analyses. Two-, three- and five-year overall survival was significantly lower in dCRT compared to TMT, with relative risks (RRs) of 0.69 (95\% CI 0.57-0.83), 0.76 (95\% CI 0.63-0.92) and 0.57 (95\% CI 0.47-0.71), respectively. When only analysing studies with equal patient groups at baseline, no significant differences for 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival were found with RRs of 0.83 (95\% CI 0.62-1.10), 0.81 (95\% CI 0.57-1.14) and 0.63 (95\% CI 0.36-1.12). CONCLUSION: These meta-analyses do not show clear survival advantage for TMT over dCRT. Only a non-significant trend towards better survival was seen, assuming comparable patient groups at baseline. Non-operative management of oesophageal carcinoma patients might be part of a personalised and tailored treatment approach in future. However, to date hard evidence proving its non-inferiority compared to operative management is lacking.},

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can be used, but limited data exists regarding the use of combined PET/CT fusion imaging and EUS in ECA staging. The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of integrated PET/CT imaging and EUS in the staging of ECA. PROCEDURES: Identification of patients diagnosed with ECA from 2004 to 2007 that underwent staging PET/CT and EUS. Data regarding tumor detection, lymph node identification, presence of metastatic disease, and affect on patient management were collected and compared between PET/CT and EUS. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients (65 male, 16 female) were identified with mean age of 63.5 years who underwent EUS and PET/CT to stage known ECA. PET/CT identified the primary tumor in 74/81 (91.4\%) of cases, compared to 81/81 (100\%) with EUS. Locoregional adenopathy was seen by PET/CT in 29/81 (35.8\%) of cases, compared to 49/81 (60.5\%) by EUS (p = 0.0001). PET/CT identified celiac axis adenopathy in 8/81 (9.9\%) of cases, compared to 11/81 (13.6\%) with EUS (p = 0.5050). PET/CT identified 17/81 (21.0\%) of patients with distant metastases who subsequently did not undergo attempt at curative surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: In ECA, EUS is superior to PET/CT for T staging and in identifying locoregional nodes, while PET/CT provides M staging. EUS and integrated PET/CT appear to independently affect treatment decisions, indicating complimentary and necessary roles in the staging of ECA.},

METHODS: Patients with SCC who underwent curative treatment from 2008 to 2014 were identified from the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Propensity score matching was undertaken to balance pretreatment clinical variables. Overall survival was compared between patients undergoing CRT-S or dCRT. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 5832 patients with clinical stage II and III oesophageal SCC receiving CRT-S (1754) or dCRT (4078) were included. After propensity score matching, each group included 1661 patients. The 3-year overall survival rate for patients treated with CRT-S was 41{$\cdot$}1 per cent compared with 17{$\cdot$}9 per cent for those who had dCRT (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001). In multivariable analysis, treatment modality was an independent prognostic factor in the overall cohort before propensity score matching: hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}45 (95 per cent c.i. 0{$\cdot$}40 to 0{$\cdot$}51) for CRT-S versus dCRT (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001). In separate analyses of patients with clinical stage II and those with stage III disease, CRT-S was associated with significantly better overall survival than dCRT.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Esophageal and gastric cancer have a poor prognosis and surgical intervention is associated with considerable morbidity, highlighting the need for careful preoperative assessment. The Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT) and Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can assess preoperative fitness. This study aims to investigate their correlation with both postoperative respiratory complications and overall survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were identified who underwent esophageal or gastric resections for cancer between 2010 and 2014 and had ISWT and/or CPET assessments. Tumor differentiation, stage, postoperative respiratory complications, and outcome were documented and then correlated with the results of the preoperative fitness assessments. RESULTS: Neither the ISWT result, anaerobic threshold (AT) nor VO2 Max correlated well with perioperative complications. However, ISWT (p~{$<~$}0.001), AT (p~{$<~$}0.001) and VO2 Max (p~{$<~$}0.001) all correlated strongly with overall survival. No patient with a score of less than 350~m on ISWT survived beyond 3 years. In a subset of patients with ISWT results both pre and post chemotherapy (n~=~49), those that had an improvement in result had a 19\% incidence of post-operative respiratory complications compared to 45\% where the result did not change or declined, though due to small numbers this only approached significance (p~=~0.08). CONCLUSION: ISWT and CPET can be useful preoperative tools to predict overall survival for patients undergoing esophago-gastric resection. Furthermore, patients that improve their functional status during chemotherapy seem to do better than those where it remains static or declines.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of clinical staging, to assess survival with surgical resection alone, and to determine factors associated with understaging in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma thought to have limited local-regional disease. BACKGROUND: Primary surgical resection is the preferred treatment in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma clinically staged to have limited nodal disease. This approach requires reliable clinical staging. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients who had primary esophagectomy for clinical stage T1-3 N0-1 adenocarcinoma (seventh edition AJCC) from January 2002 to May 2013. Clinical and pathologic stages were compared and overall survival was analyzed. RESULTS: There were 88 patients who met inclusion criteria. Final pathology confirmed appropriate clinical staging ({$\leq$}T3N1) in 76\% of patients (67/88). There were 21 patients who were understaged ({$>$}T3N1), and in all cases, understaging was based on the presence of advanced nodal (N2 or N3) disease. Factors independently associated with understaging were the presence of dysphagia, tumor length {$>$}3{$\mkern1mu$}cm, and poor differentiation. At a median follow-up of 35 months, 63\% of all patients (55/88) remain alive. The 5-year survival in correctly staged patients was 67\%, compared with 33\% for those who were understaged (P {$<$} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Modern clinical staging will accurately identify the majority of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and limited local-regional disease ({$\leq$}pT3N1). Survival with surgery alone in correctly staged patients was excellent and unlikely to be improved with neoadjuvant therapy. A combination of dysphagia, poor differentiation, and tumor length {$>$}3{$\mkern1mu$}cm was associated with understaging in 92\% of patients. Patients with these factors are likely to have more advanced disease than clinically suspected and may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy before resection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of supra-clavicular lymph node (SCLN) metastases in esophageal cancer (EC) is still not clear. METHOD: From January 2009 to December 2015, a survival analysis was performed to retrospectively identify the prognostic value of SCLN metastasis on survival on 751 patients with EC treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy (dCRT). RESULTS: The median follow-up duration for living patients was 56.6 months. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 16.6 months. Patients with SCLN metastasis had a much poorer prognosis for OS ({$\chi$}2 = 17.342, P\,{$<$}\,0.001), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) ({$\chi$}2 = 24.793, P\,{$<$} 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) ({$\chi$}2 = 25.802, P\,{$<$} 0.001) than those without SCLN metastasis. The same results were found after propensity score matching. Nonetheless, the prognosis of patients with cervical or upper thoracic EC metastasis in SCLN was better than those of patients with middle or lower thoracic EC metastasis in SCLN for OS ({$\chi$}2 = 4.516, P\,= 0.038), DMFS ({$\chi$}2 = 8.326, P\,=\,0.004) and PFS ({$\chi$}2 = 6.255, P\,= 0.012). Univariate analysis showed that gender, middle or lower thoracic EC with SCLN metastasis, tumor length, tumor diameter, concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCR) and number of lymph nodes were prognostic factors for PFS. Gender, age, middle or lower thoracic EC with SCLN metastasis, tumor diameter, tumor length, and number of lymph nodes were prognostic factors for DMFS. According to the multivariate analysis, only middle or lower thoracic EC with SCLN metastasis and number of lymph nodes were independent prognostic factors for DMFS and PFS. CONCLUSION: For patients with cervical or upper thoracic EC, metastasis in SCLN should be considered to be regional lymph nodes and treated with curative intent if the total number of lymph nodes is limited. However, for patients with middle or lower thoracic EC, metastasis should be considered to be a higher level N stage or M1 stage, and it is thus necessary to provide consolidation chemotherapy after dCRT.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate therapeutic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer, comparing PERCIST with the currently widely used response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). METHODS: Fifty-one patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, and cisplatin), followed by surgery were studied. Chemotherapeutic lesion responses were evaluated using (18)F-FDG PET and CT according to the RECIST and PERCIST methods. The PET/CT scans were obtained before chemotherapy and about 2 wk after completion of chemotherapy. Associations were statistically analyzed between survival (overall and disease-free survival) and clinicopathologic results (histology [well-, moderately, and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma], lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, clinical stage, pathologic stage, resection level, reduction rate of tumor diameter, reduction rate of tumor uptake, chemotherapeutic responses in RECIST and PERCIST, and pathologic response). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in response classification between RECIST and PERCIST (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P {$<$} 0.0001). Univariate analysis showed that lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, resection level, pathologic stage, and PERCIST were significant factors associated with disease-free or overall survival in this study. Although multivariate analysis demonstrated that venous invasion (disease-free survival: hazard ratio [HR] = 4.519, P = 0.002; overall survival: HR = 5.591, P = 0.003) and resection level (disease-free survival: HR = 11.078, P = 0.001) were the significant predictors, PERCIST was also significant in noninvasive therapy response assessment before surgery (disease-free survival: HR = 4.060, P = 0.025; overall survival: HR = 8.953, P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: RECIST based on the anatomic size reduction rate did not demonstrate the correlation between therapeutic responses and prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, PERCIST was found to be the strongest independent predictor of outcomes. Given the significance of noninvasive radiologic imaging in formulating clinical treatment strategies, PERCIST might be considered more suitable for evaluation of chemotherapeutic response to esophageal cancer than RECIST.},

  abstract = {Purpose The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) plus surgery for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains controversial. In this trial, we compared the survival and safety of NCRT plus surgery with surgery alone in patients with locally advanced ESCC. Patients and Methods From June 2007 to December 2014, 451 patients with potentially resectable thoracic ESCC, clinically staged as T1-4N1M0/T4N0M0, were randomly allocated to NCRT plus surgery (group CRT; n = 224) and surgery alone (group S; n = 227). In group CRT, patients received vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV day 1, or 25 mg/m2 IV on days 1 to 4 every 3 weeks for two cycles, with a total concurrent radiation dose of 40.0 Gy administered in 20 fractions of 2.0 Gy on 5 days per week. In both groups, patients underwent McKeown or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. The primary end point was overall survival. Results The pathologic complete response rate was 43.2\% in group CRT. Compared with group S, group CRT had a higher R0 resection rate (98.4\% v 91.2\%; P = .002), a better median overall survival (100.1 months v 66.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; P = .025), and a prolonged disease-free survival (100.1 months v 41.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.43 to 0.78; P {$<$} .001). Leukopenia (48.9\%) and neutropenia (45.7\%) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events during chemoradiotherapy. Incidences of postoperative complications were similar between groups, with the exception of arrhythmia (group CRT: 13\% v group S: 4.0\%; P = .001). Peritreatment mortality was 2.2\% in group CRT versus 0.4\% in group S ( P = .212). Conclusion This trial shows that NCRT plus surgery improves survival over surgery alone among patients with locally advanced ESCC, with acceptable and manageable adverse events.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: After curative resection, the prognosis of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is poor. This phase III trial was designed to evaluate the benefit in overall survival (OS) of perioperative fluorouracil plus cisplatin in resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 224 patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), or stomach were randomly assigned to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (CS group; n = 113) or surgery alone (S group; n = 111). Chemotherapy consisted of two or three preoperative cycles of intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m(2)) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (800 mg/m(2)/d) for 5 consecutive days (days 1 to 5) every 28 days and three or four postoperative cycles of the same regimen. The primary end point was OS. RESULTS: Compared with the S group, the CS group had a better OS (5-year rate 38\% v 24\%; hazard ratio [HR] for death: 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.50 to 0.95; P = .02); and a better disease-free survival (5-year rate: 34\% v 19\%; HR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.48 to 0.89; P = .003). In the multivariable analysis, the favorable prognostic factors for survival were perioperative chemotherapy (P = .01) and stomach tumor localization (P {$<$} .01). Perioperative chemotherapy significantly improved the curative resection rate (84\% v 73\%; P = .04). Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred in 38\% of CS patients (mainly neutropenia) but postoperative morbidity was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, GEJ, or stomach, perioperative chemotherapy using fluorouracil plus cisplatin significantly increased the curative resection rate, disease-free survival, and OS.},

  abstract = {Background: Our previous work showed that para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastasis was the major failure pattern in lower thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LTESCC) patients who presented abdominal LN failure after curative surgery. We thereby aim to generate a computerized tomography (CT)-based documentation of PALNs and to propose a clinical target volume (CTV) for this region. Methods: Sixty-five patients were enrolled. The epicentre of each PALN was drawn onto an axial CT image of a standard patient with reference to the surrounding anatomical landmarks. A CTV for PALN was generated based on the final result of node distribution, and was evaluated for dosimetric performance in three simulated patients. Results: All the studied 248 LNs were below the level of 1.0 cm above the celiac artery (CA), and 94.76\% were above the bottom of vertebra L3. Horizontally, 93.33\% of the LNs in the celiac level were located within an expansion of 1.5 cm on the CA, and 94.12\% of the LNs in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) level were within 1.5 cm on the left side of the SMA. Below the SMA, all the LNs were behind the left renal vein, left to the right border of the inferior vena cava, and 98.51\% of the LNs were medial to the lateral surface of the left psoas major. The proposed CTV could cover 92.74\% of the LNs and was dosimetrically feasible. Conclusions: The proposed CTV is the first one to focus on the high-risk area of abdominal failure in LTESCC patients after surgery and can serve as a reference in the adjuvant radiotherapy for LTESCC patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for treating cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction remains controversial. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of these two management strategies. METHODS: The MEDLINE (PubMed), SinoMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for eligible studies. We searched for the most relevant studies published until the end of September 2017. Data were extracted independently and were analyzed using RevMan statistical software version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, http://tech.cochrane.org/revman/download). Weighted mean differences, risk ratios (RRs), and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. In this comprehensive meta-analysis, we examined the efficiency of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction as reported in qualified clinical trials. RESULTS: Six qualified articles that included a total of 866 patients were identified. The meta-analysis showed that for 3-year and 5-year survival rates in primary outcomes, the results favored neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy strategies compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (RR = 0.78, 95\% CI = 0.62-0.98, P = 0.03; RR = 0.69, 95\% CI = 0.50-0.96, P = 0.03, respectively). In terms of secondary outcomes, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy significantly increased the rate of R0 resection and pathological complete response as well (RR = 0.87, 95\% CI = 0.81-0.92, P {$<$} 0.0001; RR = 0.16, 95\% CI = 0.09-0.28, P {$<$} 0.00001, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in postoperative mortality between the two groups (RR = 1.85, 95\% CI = 0.93-3.65, P = 0.08). For the results of postoperative complications, revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of postoperative complications such as pulmonary, anastomotic leak and cardiovascular complications. The subgroup analysis of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma showed that both esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients achieved a high rate of R0 resection (RR = 0.85, 95\% CI = 0.77-0.93, P = 0.0006; RR = 0.88, 95\% CI = 0.81-0.96, P = 0.005, respectively) and pathological complete response benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (RR = 0.23, 95\% CI = 0.09-0.57, P = 0.001; RR = 0.18, 95\% CI = 0.03-0.96, P = 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be recommended with a significant long-term survival benefit in patients with cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction. In view of the clinical heterogeneity, whether these conclusions are broadly applicable should be further determined.},

  abstract = {Some controversy surrounds the postoperative feeding regimen utilized in patients who undergo esophagectomy. Variation in practices during the perioperative period exists including the type of nutrition started, the delivery route, and its timing. Adequate nutrition is essential for this patient population as these patients often present with weight loss and have altered eating patterns after surgery, which can affect their ability to regain or maintain weight. Methods of feeding after an esophagectomy include total parenteral nutrition, nasoduodenal/nasojejunal tube feeding, jejunostomy tube feeding, and oral feeding. Recent evidence suggests that early oral feeding is associated with shorter LOS, faster return of bowel function, and improved quality of life. Enhanced recovery pathways after surgery pathways after esophagectomy with a component of early oral feeding also seem to be safe, feasible, and cost-effective, albeit with limited data. However, data on anastomotic leaks is mixed, and some studies suggest that the incidence of leaks may be higher with early oral feeding. This risk of anastomotic leak with early feeding may be heavily modulated by surgical approach. No definitive data is currently available to definitively answer this question, and further studies should look at how these early feeding regimens vary by surgical technique. This review aims to discuss the existing literature on the optimal route and timing of feeding after esophagectomy.},

In a selective-surgery paradigm, the benefit of TMT in patients with a complete clinical response is controversial. Factors associated with survival in patients with a clinical complete response to chemoradiation were evaluated. METHODS: Patients with stage II-III oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with TMT or BMT from 2002 to 2017 were evaluated. The BMT group consisted of patients who were otherwise eligible for surgery but underwent chemoradiation alone followed by observation. This group included patients who later had salvage oesophagectomy. Survival was evaluated and compared between TMT and BMT groups. Elastic net regularization was performed to select co-variables for Cox multivariable survival analysis in patients with a clinical complete response. RESULTS: Of 143 patients, 60 (41.9 per cent) underwent TMT and 83 (58.0 per cent) BMT. Patients who underwent TMT had longer median overall survival than those who had BMT (77 versus 33\,months; P\,=\,0.019). For patients with a clinical complete response, TMT achieved longer median overall survival than BMT (123 versus 55\,months; P\,=\,0.04). BMT had a high locoregional recurrence rate (48 versus 6 per cent; P\,{$<$}\,0.001); 26 of 29 patients with locoregional recurrence in the BMT groupunderwent salvage resection. Cox multivariable analysis demonstrated that upper-mid oesophageal tumour location (hazard ratio (HR) 2.04; P\,=\,0.024) and tumour length (HR 1.18; P\,=\,0.046) were associated with worse survival. Although TMT was not associated with survival, it was a predictor of reduced recurrence (HR 0.28; P\,=\,0.028). The maximum standardized uptake value after chemoradiation also predicted recurrence (HR 1.33; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients who achieve a clinical complete response, TMT reduces locoregional recurrence but may not prolong survival. The differences in survival outcomes may be due to patient selection; therefore, a selective-surgery strategy in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a reasonable approach.},

However, it is unknown whether MIO has superiority in reducing the occurrence of in-hospital mortality (IHM). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis was to explore the effect of MIO vs. OE on the occurrence of in-hospital mortality (IHM). DATA SOURCES: Sources such as Medline (through December 31, 2014), Embase (through December 31, 2014), Wiley Online Library (through December 31, 2014), and the Cochrane Library (through December 31, 2014) were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Data of randomized and non-randomized clinical trials related to MIO versus OE were included. INTERVENTIONS: Eligible studies were those that reported patients who underwent MIO procedure. The control group included patients undergoing conventional OE. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Fixed or random -effects models were used to calculate summary odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) for quantification of associations. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies involving 14,311 cases of resectable oesophageal cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to patients undergoing OE, patients undergoing MIO had statistically reduced occurrence of IHM (OR=0.69, 95\%CI =0.55 -0.86). Patients undergoing MIO also had significantly reduced incidence of pulmonary complications (PCs) (RR=0.73, 95\%CI = 0.63-0.86), pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR=0.71, 95\%CI= 0.51-0.99) and arrhythmia (OR=0.79, 95\%CI = 0.68-0.92). Non-significant reductions were observed among the included studies in the occurrence of anastomotic leak (AL) (OR=0.93, 95\%CI =0.78-1.11), or Gastric Tip Necrosis (GTN) (OR=0.89, 95\%CI =0.54-1.49). LIMITATION: Most of the included studies were non-randomized case-control studies, with a diversity of study designs, demographics of participants and surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) has superiority over open oesophagectomy (OE) in terms of the occurrence of in-hospital mortality (IHM) and should be the first-choice surgical procedure in esophageal surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for gastrointestinal cancer surgical intervention in high-risk patients recommend postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) chemical prophylaxis for 4 weeks with low-dose unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin, but specific guidelines for esophagectomy are lacking. This survey identified the clinical patterns affecting postesophagectomy VTE chemoprophylaxis use among general thoracic surgeons. METHODS: General Thoracic Surgery Club members were invited to complete an online survey on VTE prophylaxis to analyze clinical factors affecting their choices. RESULTS: Seventy-seven surgeons (37\% membership) responded; of these, 94\% (72 of 77) completed fellowships, and 76\% (58 of 77) worked at universities. VTE chemoprophylaxis administration varied widely in drug, dosing, and duration, with 30\% using suboptimal dosing of unfractionated heparin (every 12 hours). Participants agreed that esophagectomy patients are at high VTE risk, yet 29\% (22 of 76) of surgeons delay VTE chemoprophylaxis until postoperative day 1. Only 13\% (10 of 77) prescribe postdischarge chemoprophylaxis. Minimally invasive surgeons ({$>$}90\% of cases) were more likely to prescribe postdischarge prophylaxis (p~= 0.007). Epidurals, routinely used by 65\% (51 of 78), led to less compliance with recommended dosing. Only 53\% (27 of 51) of pain teams allow unfractionated heparin every 8~hours, yet 73\% (37 of 51) allow suboptimal dosing (every 12 h). Postoperative major complications were identified as a VTE risk factor by only 21\% (15 of 72) of surgeons. Most (92\% [68 of 74]) would follow esophagectomy-specific guidelines, if developed. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic surgeons agree that VTE chemoprophylaxis is necessary for esophagectomy, yet substantial variability exists in current practice. A noteworthy proportion use suboptimal dosing, and very few choose postdischarge prophylaxis. To improve postesophagectomy morbidity and mortality outcomes, thoracic surgeons are willing to follow evidence-based guidelines for VTE chemoprophylaxis.},
