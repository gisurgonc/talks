  abstract = {We conducted an individual-patient-data meta-analysis of the efficacy of chemotherapy on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced/recurrent gastric cancer (AGC). Our primary research question was whether the experimental arms of the trials included in the meta-analysis showed a benefit as compared with their corresponding control arms. MEDLINE (up to 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, National Institutes of Health (NIH) trial registry and proceedings of major oncologic and gastrointestinal cancer meetings were searched. Randomised controlled trials for AGC closed to patient accrual before the end of 2006 were eligible. As of December 2010, individual patient data were available from 22 trials (4245 patients, representing 47\% of the targeted data) of 55 eligible trials. The overall comparison of experimental arms with the corresponding control arms showed statistically significant differences in terms of both OS and PFS. Hazard ratio was 0.88 (95\% confidence interval 0.82\textendash 0.94, P{$<$}0.0001) for OS and 0.81 (0.76\textendash 0.88, P{$<$}0.0001) for PFS. The results of the sub-analysis of adding a given chemotherapeutic agent to any chemotherapy confirm the results of the overall analysis, with a hazard reduction of 11\% for OS (P{$<$}0.01) and 26\% for PFS (P{$<$}0.0001). This meta-analysis of individual patient data shows that the additions of experimental chemotherapeutic agents to pre-existing control or standard regimens have produced a modest improvement in OS and PFS. Median survival remained below 1year for all investigated chemotherapy regimens and none emerged as a clear standard.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adipose tissues (AT) are highly metabolically active complex endocrine organs and are classified into white (WAT) and brown AT (BAT) with proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory characteristics. The current study investigated the accuracy of computed tomography (CT) to quantitatively detect BAT and WAT based on Hounsfield unit (HU) threshold compared to standardized uptake values (SUVs) of corresponding AT with the use of positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: One hundred twenty-four patients who underwent whole-body (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT were studied. The SUVs and HUs of regions of BAT and WAT were measured and compared in these scans. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to detect the HU threshold values for the detection of BAT and WAT. RESULTS: The CT HU of BAT, with high (18)F-FDG uptake, was significantly higher compared to WAT (-67.1~{$\pm~$}8.2 [-10 to -87] versus -93.5~{$\pm~$}10.1 [-88 to -190], P~=~.0006). Generalized linear-regression models revealed that mean CT HU of BAT was 26.4 HU higher than that of WAT (P~=~.001). A strong agreement between CT HU and PET SUV in measuring metabolically active AT (r(2)~=~0.81, P~=~.0001) was observed. The ROC curve showed that the optimal cutoff value of CT HU to detect BAT was HU~{$\geq$}-87 with sensitivity of 83.3\% and specificity of 100\%, and the negative CT HU below -87 is highly specific for WAT. CONCLUSION: In our study, CT can accurately and quantitatively detect BAT and WAT based on CT HU threshold, which is -10 to -87 for~BAT and -88 to -190 for WAT.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Preoperative therapy for localized gastric cancer has considerable appeal. We hypothesized that, in a cooperative group setting, preoperative chemoradiotherapy would induce a 20\% pathologic complete response (pathCR) rate. Combined-modality therapy quality, survival, and safety were secondary end points. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with localized gastric adenocarcinoma were eligible. A negative laparoscopic evaluation was required. Patients received two cycles of induction fluorouracil, leucovorin, and cisplatin followed by concurrent radiation and chemotherapy (infusional fluorouracil and weekly paclitaxel). Resection was attempted 5 to 6 weeks after chemoradiotherapy was completed. Quality of therapy was assessed with other end points. RESULTS: Twenty institutions participated. Forty-nine patients were entered and 43 were assessable (12\% stage IB; 37\% stage II; and 52\% stage III). The pathCR and R0 resection rates were 26\% and 77\%, respectively. At 1 year, more patients with pathCR (82\%) are living than those with less than pathCR (69\%). Grade 4 toxicity occurred in 21\% of patients. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery per protocol (including acceptable variations) occurred in 98\%, 44\%, and 63\% of patients, respectively. A D2 dissection was performed in 50\% of patients. Of 18 major radiotherapy variations, 17 were due to the lack of inclusion of the L3-4 vertebral interphase as prespecified. CONCLUSION: For localized gastric cancer, preoperative chemoradiotherapy strategy achieved a pathCR rate of more than 20\% in a cooperative group setting. The quality of surgery improved (50\% with D2 dissection) possibly because surgery was part of this trial. With some refinements, this preoperative chemoradiotherapy strategy is poised for a randomized comparison with postoperative adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with gastric cancer.},

This study reports on the safety and efficacy of the docetaxel-based triplet FLOT (fluorouracil plus leucovorin, oxaliplatin and docetaxel) as a perioperative therapy for patients with locally advanced, resectable tumours. METHODS: In this controlled, open-label, phase 2/3 trial, we randomly assigned 716 patients with histologically-confirmed advanced clinical stage cT2 or higher or nodal positive stage (cN+), or both, resectable tumours, with no evidence of distant metastases, via central interactive web-based-response system, to receive either three pre-operative and three postoperative 3-week cycles of 50 mg/m2 epirubicin and 60 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 plus either 200 mg/m2 fluorouracil as continuous intravenous infusion or 1250 mg/m2 capecitabine orally on days 1 to 21 (ECF/ECX; control group) or four preoperative and four postoperative 2-week cycles of 50 mg/m2 docetaxel, 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin, 200 mg/m2 leucovorin and 2600 mg/m2 fluorouracil as 24-h infusion on day 1 (FLOT; experimental group). The primary outcome of the trial was overall survival (superiority) analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01216644. FINDINGS: Between Aug 8, 2010, and Feb 10, 2015, 716 patients were randomly assigned to treatment in 38 German hospitals or with practice-based oncologists. 360 patients were assigned to ECF/ECX and 356 patients to FLOT. Overall survival was increased in the FLOT group compared with the ECF/ECX group (hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}77; 95\% confidence interval [CI; 0.63 to 0{$\cdot$}94]; median overall survival, 50 months [38{$\cdot$}33 to not reached] vs 35 months [27{$\cdot$}35 to 46{$\cdot$}26]). The number of patients with related serious adverse events (including those occurring during hospital stay for surgery) was similar in the two groups (96 [27\%] in the ECF/ECX group vs 97 [27\%] in the FLOT group), as was the number of toxic deaths (two [{$<$}1\%] in both groups). Hospitalisation for toxicity occurred in 94 patients (26\%) in the ECF/ECX group and 89 patients (25\%) in the FLOT group. INTERPRETATION: In locally advanced, resectable gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, perioperative FLOT improved overall survival compared with perioperative ECF/ECX.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evidence that body composition parameters influence multiple cancer outcomes is rapidly expanding. Excess adiposity deposits in muscle tissue, termed myosteatosis, can be detected in CT scans through variations in the density of muscle tissues (Hounsfield Units). Patients with similar muscle mass but different amounts of intramuscular adipose infiltration have increased chemotherapy toxicity, time to tumor progression and other adverse outcomes among different cancer types. Our review examines the impact of myosteatosis on overall survival (OS) in patients with cancer. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was conducted on PubMed/ MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and EMBASE. Meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality assessment for cohort studies, funnel plot (publication bias), and GRADE summary of findings tool from Cochrane. RESULTS: A total of 4880 articles were screened from which 40 articles selected, including 21,222 patients. The overall mean proportion of patients with myosteatosis was 48 \% (range 11-85 \%). Using skeletal muscle density (SMD), patients classified as having myosteatosis had 75 \% greater mortality risk compared to non-myosteatosis patients (HR 1.75 95 \% CI 1.60-1.92, 40 studies) (p {$<$} .00001) (i2 = 62 \%). Specifically, myosteatosis was prognostic for worse OS in patients with gynecological, renal, periampullary/pancreatic, hepatocellular, gastroesophageal, and colorectal carcinoma, and lymphomas. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of the literature shows that cancer patients with myosteatosis have shorter survival. Our findings suggest that in oncological practice, muscle density assessment is valuable as a prognostic parameter.},

Data from one prospective and one retrospective study were used to determine if the highest doses of oxaliplatin/kg LBM within FOLFOX regimens would be associated with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in colon cancer patients. Toxicity over four cycles was graded according to NCI Common Toxicity Criteria V2 or V3 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). Muscle tissue was measured by computerized tomography (CT) and used to evaluate the LBM compartment of the whole body. In prospective randomized clinical trials conducted in France (n = 58), for patients given FOLFOX-based regimens according to body surface area, values of oxaliplatin/kg LBM were highly variable, ranging from 2.55 to 6.6 mg/kg LBM. A cut point of 3.09 mg oxaliplatin/kg LBM for developing toxicity was determined by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, below this value 0/17 (0.0\%) of patients experienced DLT; in contrast above this value 18/41 (44.0\%) of patients were dose reduced or had treatment terminated owing to toxicity ({$\geq$}Grade 3 or neuropathy {$\geq$}Grade 2); for 9/41 the DLT was sensory neuropathy. These findings were validated in an independent cohort of colon cancer patients (n = 80) receiving FOLFOX regimens as part of standard care, in Canada. Low LBM is a significant predictor of toxicity and neuropathy in patients administered FOLFOX-based regimens using conventional body surface area (BSA) dosing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: There is increasing use of computed tomography (CT) in sarcopenia research using a wide variety of techniques. We performed a systematic review of the CT literature to identify the differences between approaches used. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed from 1983 to 2017 was performed to identify studies that used CT muscle measurements to assess muscle mass and myosteatosis. The CT protocols were evaluated based on anatomic landmark(s), thresholding, muscle(s) segmented, key measurement (ie, muscle attenuation, cross-sectional area, volume), derived variables, and analysis software. From the described search, 657 articles were identified and 388 studies met inclusion criteria for this systematic review. RESULTS: Muscle mass was more commonly assessed than myosteatosis (330 vs. 125). The most commonly assessed muscle or muscle groups were total abdominal wall musculature (142/330 and 49/125 for muscle mass and myosteatosis, respectively) and total thigh musculature (90/330 and 48/125). The most commonly used landmark in the abdomen was the L3 vertebra (123/142 and 45/49 for muscle mass and myosteatosis, respectively). Skeletal muscle index and intermuscular adipose tissue were the most commonly used measures of abdominal wall muscle mass (114/142) and myosteatosis (27/49), respectively. Cut points varied across studies. A significant majority of studies failed to report important CT technical parameters, such as use of intravenous contrast and slice thickness (94\% and 63\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in the CT approaches used for the assessment of muscle mass and myosteatosis. There is a need to develop consensus for CT-based evaluation of sarcopenia and myosteatosis.},

  abstract = {Oesophageal cancer is a debilitating disease with a poor prognosis, and weight loss owing to malnutrition prevails in the majority of patients. Cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome characterized by the loss of fat and skeletal muscle mass and systemic inflammation arising from complex host-tumour interactions is a major contributor to malnutrition, which is a determinant of tolerance to treatment and survival. In patients with oesophageal cancer, cachexia is further compounded by eating difficulties owing to the stage and location of the tumour, and the effects of neoadjuvant therapy. Treatment with curative intent involves exceptionally extensive and invasive surgery, and the subsequent anatomical changes often lead to eating difficulties and severe postoperative malnutrition. Thus, screening for cachexia by means of percentage weight loss and BMI during the cancer trajectory and survivorship periods is imperative. Additionally, markers of inflammation (such as C-reactive protein), dysphagia and appetite loss should be assessed at diagnosis. Routine assessments of body composition are also necessary in patients with oesophageal cancer to enable assessment of skeletal muscle loss, which might be masked by sarcopenic obesity in these patients. A need exists for clinical trials examining the effectiveness of therapeutic and physical-activity-based interventions in mitigating muscle loss and counteracting cachexia in these patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe weight loss is experienced by patients with eating difficulties after surgery for oesophageal cancer. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to asssess the influence of eating difficulties and severe weight loss on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) up to 10\,years after oesophagectomy. METHODS: Data on bodyweight and HRQoL were collected at 6\,months, 3, 5 and 10\,years in patients who underwent surgery for oesophageal cancer in Sweden between 2001 and 2005. Exposures were percentage weight loss, and eating difficulties defined by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-OES18 questionnaire. Outcomes were HRQoL scores from the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Repeated-measures ANOVA, adjusting for potential confounders, was used to assess the association between eating difficulties and weight loss (4 exposure groups) and HRQoL scores at each time point. Mean score differences (MDs) between time points or exposure groups were defined as clinically relevant in accordance with evidence-based interpretation guidelines. RESULTS: In total, 92 of 104 10-year survivors (88{$\cdot$}5 per cent) responded to the questionnaires. Weight loss was greatest within 6\,months of surgery. Patients with eating difficulties with or without weight loss reported clinically and statistically significantly worsened HRQoL in almost all aspects. The largest MD was seen between 5 and 10\,years after surgery for global quality of life, physical, role and social function (MD -22 to -30), as well for fatigue, nausea, dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss and diarrhoea (MD 24-36). CONCLUSION: Eating difficulties are associated with deterioration in several aspects of HRQoL up to 10\,years after surgery for oesophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade has clinical benefit in microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch-repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors after previous therapy. The efficacy of PD-1 blockade as compared with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for MSI-H-dMMR advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer is unknown. METHODS: In this phase 3, open-label trial, 307 patients with metastatic MSI-H-dMMR colorectal cancer who had not previously received treatment were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks or chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil-based therapy with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab) every 2 weeks. Patients receiving chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab therapy after disease progression. The two primary end points were progression-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: At the second interim analysis, after a median follow-up (from randomization to data cutoff) of 32.4 months (range, 24.0 to 48.3), pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival (median, 16.5 vs. 8.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.80; P\,=\,0.0002). The estimated restricted mean survival after 24 months of follow-up was 13.7 months (range, 12.0 to 15.4) as compared with 10.8 months (range, 9.4 to 12.2). As of the data cutoff date, 56 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 69 in the chemotherapy group had died. Data on overall survival were still evolving (66\% of required events had occurred) and remain blinded until the final analysis. An overall response (complete or partial response), as evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, was observed in 43.8\% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and 33.1\% in the chemotherapy group. Among patients with an overall response, 83\% in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 35\% of patients in the chemotherapy group, had ongoing responses at 24 months. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 22\% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group, as compared with 66\% (including one patient who died) in the chemotherapy group. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab led to significantly longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy when received as first-line therapy for MSI-H-dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, with fewer treatment-related adverse events.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies over the past 10\,years strongly support an association between skeletal muscle mass (SMM) depletion and outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Factors influencing SMM changes over time are, however, poorly studied. We analyzed the impact of SMM on overall survival and chemotherapy toxicities in mCRC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy. Changes in weight and body composition were evaluated during follow-up. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the randomized phase II ACCORD trial comparing two chemotherapy regimens were screened. Body composition parameters (SMM, adipose tissue) were assessed prospectively with computed tomography (CT) imaging, and toxicities were recorded. Mixed models were used to assess weight and BC changes during 4\,months of treatment follow-up. RESULTS: Among 145 patients included in ACCORD, 76 had available baseline CT scans and were included in the current study. Mean age was 60.6\,{$\pm$}\,10.0\,years, 50\% were women, 82\% had colon cancer, and 62\% had two or more metastatic sites. At baseline, 49\% had lost at least 5\% of their initial weight, including 26\% who had lost more than 10\%; 53\% had SMM depletion. In this homogenous cohort, there were no statistically significant associations between SMM depletion and overall survival, progression-free survival or chemotherapy toxicity. There were no decreases in weight or SMM during follow-up. Weight and SMM changes were not influenced by diarrhea either grade 3-4 or any grade (reported in 74\% of patients). For patients with weight loss {$\geq$}10\% at baseline, SMM increased significantly after 4\,months of follow-up and after disease stabilization following chemotherapy (P\,=\,0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In a homogenous mCRC cohort, SMM depletion was not associated with survival or chemotherapy toxicity. Despite most patient experiencing diarrhea, no changes in weight or SMM were found during 4\,months of follow-up. However, hypotheses deriving from our exploratory study have to be tested in further larger sample size studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00423696 (2011).},

  abstract = {Cancers are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the number of new cases is expected to rise significantly over the next decades. At the same time, all types of cancer treatment, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and pharmacological therapies are improving in sophistication, precision and in the power to target specific characteristics of individual cancers. Thus, while many cancers may still not be cured they may be converted to chronic diseases. All of these treatments, however, are impeded or precluded by the frequent development of malnutrition and metabolic derangements in cancer patients, induced by the tumor or by its treatment. These evidence-based guidelines were developed to translate current best evidence and expert opinion into recommendations for multi-disciplinary teams responsible for identification, prevention, and treatment of reversible elements of malnutrition in adult cancer patients. The guidelines were commissioned and financially supported by ESPEN and by the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer (EPAAC), an EU level initiative. Members of the guideline group were selected by ESPEN to include a range of professions and fields of expertise. We searched for meta-analyses, systematic reviews and comparative studies based on clinical questions according to the PICO format. The evidence was evaluated and merged to develop clinical recommendations using the GRADE method. Due to the deficits in the available evidence, relevant still open questions were listed and should be addressed by future studies. Malnutrition and a loss of muscle mass are frequent in cancer patients and have a negative effect on clinical outcome. They may be driven by inadequate food intake, decreased physical activity and catabolic metabolic derangements. To screen for, prevent, assess in detail, monitor and treat malnutrition standard operating procedures, responsibilities and a quality control process should be established at each institution involved in treating cancer patients. All cancer patients should be screened regularly for the risk or the presence of malnutrition. In all patients - with the exception of end of life care - energy and substrate requirements should be met by offering in a step-wise manner nutritional interventions from counseling to parenteral nutrition. However, benefits and risks of nutritional interventions have to be balanced with special consideration in patients with advanced disease. Nutritional care should always be accompanied by exercise training. To counter malnutrition in patients with advanced cancer there are few pharmacological agents and pharmaconutrients with only limited effects. Cancer survivors should engage in regular physical activity and adopt a prudent diet.},

As there are no such data in patients with oesophagogastric cancer (OGC), this study investigated changes in body composition in OGC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS: OGC patients who had CT scans before and after NAC were studied. CT images at the L3 vertebral level were analysed using SliceOmatic(\textregistered ) software to derive estimates of FFM and fat mass (FM). Comparisons were made between pre- and post-NAC CT images. Data are reported as mean~{$\pm~$}SD. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (34 male) aged 63~{$\pm~$}12 years were studied and 79\% completed their course of NAC. The interval between CT scans was 107~{$\pm~$}27 days. The proportion of patients with sarcopenia increased from 57\% pre-NAC to 79\% post-NAC (p~=~0.046). During NAC there were significant reductions in estimated FFM and FM (2.9~{$\pm~$}4.7~kg, p~{$<~$}0.0001 and 1.3~{$\pm~$}3.2~kg, p~=~0.007, respectively). No association was demonstrated between loss of FFM and non-completion of NAC, increased hospital stay or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with OGC commencing NAC, sarcopenia was present in 57\%. NAC was associated with further reductions in FFM and an increase in the proportion of patients becoming sarcopenic.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systemic relapses remain a major problem in locally advanced rectal cancer. Using short-course radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy and delayed surgery, the Rectal cancer And Preoperative Induction therapy followed by Dedicated Operation (RAPIDO) trial aimed to reduce distant metastases without compromising locoregional control. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial, participants were recruited from 54 centres in the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Slovenia, Denmark, Norway, and the USA. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, had a biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed, primary, locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma, which was classified as high risk on pelvic MRI (with at least one of the following criteria: clinical tumour [cT] stage cT4a or cT4b, extramural vascular invasion, clinical nodal [cN] stage cN2, involved mesorectal fascia, or enlarged lateral lymph nodes), were mentally and physically fit for chemotherapy, and could be assessed for staging within 5 weeks before randomisation. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a management system with a randomly varying block design (each block size randomly chosen to contain two to four allocations), stratified by centre, ECOG performance status, cT stage, and cN stage, to either the experimental or standard of care group. All investigators remained masked for the primary endpoint until a prespecified number of events was reached. Patients allocated to the experimental treatment group received short-course radiotherapy (5\hphantom{,}\texttimes\hphantom{,}5 Gy over a maximum of 8 days) followed by six cycles of CAPOX chemotherapy (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-14, oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, and a chemotherapy-free interval between days 15-21) or nine cycles of FOLFOX4 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, leucovorin [folinic acid] 200 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 2, followed by bolus fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 intravenously and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenously for 22 h on days 1 and 2, and a chemotherapy-free interval between days 3-14) followed by total mesorectal excision. Choice of CAPOX or FOLFOX4 was per physician discretion or hospital policy. Patients allocated to the standard of care group received 28 daily fractions of 1{$\cdot$}8 Gy up to 50{$\cdot$}4 Gy or 25 fractions of 2{$\cdot$}0 Gy up to 50{$\cdot$}0 Gy (per physician discretion or hospital policy), with concomitant twice-daily oral capecitabine 825 mg/m2 followed by total mesorectal excision and, if stipulated by hospital policy, adjuvant chemotherapy with eight cycles of CAPOX or 12 cycles of FOLFOX4. The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-related treatment failure, defined as the first occurrence of locoregional failure, distant metastasis, new primary colorectal tumour, or treatment-related death, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed by intention to treat. This study is registered with the EudraCT, 2010-023957-12, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01558921, and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between June 21, 2011, and June 2, 2016, 920 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment, of whom 912 were eligible (462 in the experimental group; 450 in the standard of care group). Median follow-up was 4{$\cdot$}6 years (IQR 3{$\cdot$}5-5{$\cdot$}5). At 3 years after randomisation, the cumulative probability of disease-related treatment failure was 23{$\cdot$}7\% (95\% CI 19{$\cdot$}8-27{$\cdot$}6) in the experimental group versus 30{$\cdot$}4\% (26{$\cdot$}1-34{$\cdot$}6) in the standard of care group (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}75, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}60-0{$\cdot$}95; p=0{$\cdot$}019). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse event during preoperative therapy in both groups was diarrhoea (81 [18\%] of 460 patients in the experimental group and 41 [9\%] of 441 in the standard of care group) and neurological toxicity during adjuvant chemotherapy in the standard of care group (16 [9\%] of 187 patients). Serious adverse events occurred in 177 (38\%) of 460 participants in the experimental group and, in the standard of care group, in 87 (34\%) of 254 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy and in 64 (34\%) of 187 with adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four participants in the experimental group (one cardiac arrest, one pulmonary embolism, two infectious complications) and in four participants in the standard of care group (one pulmonary embolism, one neutropenic sepsis, one aspiration, one suicide due to severe depression). INTERPRETATION: The observed decreased probability of disease-related treatment failure in the experimental group is probably indicative of the increased efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy as opposed to adjuvant chemotherapy in this setting. Therefore, the experimental treatment can be considered as a new standard of care in high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer.

Older adults have been underrepresented in cancer clinical trials, leading to paucity of guidelines to meet the treatment challenges in this population. To evaluate an older adult with cancer, oncologists must understand age-related changes and identify the subset of population who is vulnerable and at risk of cancer treatment toxicity. Comprehensive geriatric assessments focusing on functional status, multimorbidity, nutritional status, cognitive impairment, and psychosocial support help recognize heterogeneity among older adults, leading to individualized approaches toward cancer treatment.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: D2 gastrectomy is recommended in US and European guidelines, and is preferred in east Asia, for patients with resectable gastric cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy improves patient outcomes after surgery, but the benefits after a D2 resection have not been extensively investigated in large-scale trials. We investigated the effect on disease-free survival of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin after D2 gastrectomy compared with D2 gastrectomy only in patients with stage II-IIIB gastric cancer. METHODS: The capecitabine and oxaliplatin adjuvant study in stomach cancer (CLASSIC) study was an open-label, parallel-group, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 37 centres in South Korea, China, and Taiwan. Patients with stage II-IIIB gastric cancer who had had curative D2 gastrectomy were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant chemotherapy of eight 3-week cycles of oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1 to 14 of each cycle) plus intravenous oxaliplatin (130 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle) for 6 months or surgery only. Block randomisation was done by a central interactive computerised system, stratified by country and disease stage. Patients, and investigators giving interventions, assessing outcomes, and analysing data were not masked. The primary endpoint was 3 year disease-free survival, analysed by intention to treat. This study reports a prespecified interim efficacy analysis, after which the trial was stopped after a recommendation by the data monitoring committee. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00411229). FINDINGS: 1035 patients were randomised (520 to receive chemotherapy and surgery, 515 surgery only). Median follow-up was 34{$\cdot$}2 months (25{$\cdot$}4-41{$\cdot$}7) in the chemotherapy and surgery group and 34{$\cdot$}3 months (25{$\cdot$}6-41{$\cdot$}9) in the surgery only group. 3 year disease-free survival was 74\% (95\% CI 69-79) in the chemotherapy and surgery group and 59\% (53-64) in the surgery only group (hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}56, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}44-0{$\cdot$}72; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 279 of 496 patients (56\%) in the chemotherapy and surgery group and in 30 of 478 patients (6\%) in the surgery only group. The most common adverse events in the intervention group were nausea (n=326), neutropenia (n=300), and decreased appetite (n=294). INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant capecitabine plus oxaliplatin treatment after curative D2 gastrectomy should be considered as a treatment option for patients with operable gastric cancer.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prominent clinical feature of cachexia has traditionally been understood to be weight loss; however, in recognition of the potential for divergent behavior of muscle and adipose tissue, cachexia was recently defined as loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. Detailed assessments are required to verify body composition in patients with cancer cachexia. DESIGN: We adopted a population-based approach to study body composition in patients with cancer, with the use of diagnostic computed tomography images acquired for cancer diagnosis and follow-up. A prospective cohort of 441 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, who were referred consecutively to a regional medical oncology service in Alberta, Canada, was evaluated. RESULTS: At referral (median time to death: 265 d), mean body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) was 24.9, with 47.4\% of patients being overweight or obese. Only 7.5\% overall were underweight as conventionally understood (BMI {$<$} 18.5). Analysis of computed tomography images showed extremely high heterogeneity of muscle mass within all strata of BMI. The overall prevalence of severe muscle depletion (sarcopenia) was 46.8\% and was present in patients in all BMI categories. A much higher proportion of men (61\%) than women (31\%) met the criteria for sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Wasting of skeletal muscle is a prominent feature of patients with lung cancer, despite normal or heavy body weights. The significance of muscle wasting in normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients as a nutritional risk factor, as a prognostic factor, and as a predictor of cancer treatment toxicity is discussed in this article.},

We evaluated the effect of sarcopenia on chemotherapy toxicity among metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. All consecutive mCRC patients in 3 hospitals were enrolled in this prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study. Several nutritional indexes and scores were generated. Computed tomography (CT) images were analyzed to evaluate cross-sectional areas of muscle tissue (MT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Toxicities were evaluated in the 2 mo following clinical evaluation. Fifty-one mCRC patients were included in the study. Sarcopenia was observed in 71\% of patients (39\% of women and 82\% of men) whereas only 4\% and 18\% were considered as underweight using body mass index (BMI) or severely malnourished using the Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), respectively. Grade 3-4 toxicities were observed in 28\% of patients. In multivariate analysis including age, sex, BMI, sarcopenia, SAT, and VAT, the only factor associated with Grade 3-4 toxicities was sarcopenia (odds ratio = 13.55; 95\% confidence interval [1.08; 169.31], P = 0.043). In mCRC patients undergoing chemotherapy, sarcopenia was much more frequently observed than visible malnutrition. Despite the small number of patients included in our study, we found sarcopenia to be significantly associated with severe chemotherapy toxicity.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Uncontrolled studies suggest that chemoradiation has similar efficacy as surgery for esophageal cancer. Therefore, a randomized trial was carried out to compare, in responders only, chemoradiation alone with chemoradiation followed by surgery in patients with locally advanced tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had operable T3N0-1M0 thoracic esophageal cancer. Patients received two cycles of fluorouracil (FU) and cisplatin (days 1 to 5 and 22 to 26) and either conventional (46 Gy in 4.5 weeks) or split-course (15 Gy, days 1 to 5 and 22 to 26) concomitant radiotherapy. Patients with response and no contraindication to either treatment were randomly assigned to surgery (arm A) or continuation of chemoradiation (arm B; three cycles of FU/cisplatin and either conventional [20 Gy] or split-course [15 Gy] radiotherapy). Chemoradiation was considered equivalent to surgery if the difference in 2-year survival rate was less than 10\%. RESULTS: Of 444 eligible patients, 259 were randomly assigned; 230 patients (88.8\%) had epidermoid cancer, and 29 (11.2\%) had glandular carcinoma. Two-year survival rate was 34\% in arm A versus 40\% in arm B (hazard ratio for arm B v arm A = 0.90; adjusted P = .44). Median survival time was 17.7 months in arm A compared with 19.3 months in arm B. Two-year local control rate was 66.4\% in arm A compared with 57.0\% in arm B, and stents were less required in the surgery arm (5\% in arm A v 32\% in arm B; P {$<$} .001). The 3-month mortality rate was 9.3\% in arm A compared with 0.8\% in arm B (P = .002). Cumulative hospital stay was 68 days in arm A compared with 52 days in arm B (P = .02). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that, in patients with locally advanced thoracic esophageal cancers, especially epidermoid, who respond to chemoradiation, there is no benefit for the addition of surgery after chemoradiation compared with the continuation of additional chemoradiation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Barrett's oesophagus is one of the most common pre-malignant lesions in the world. Currently the mainstay of therapy is surgical management of advanced cancer but this has improved the five-year survival very little since the 1980s. As a consequence, improved survival relies on early detection through endoscopic surveillance programmes. Success of this strategy relies on the fact that late-stage pre-malignant lesions or very early cancers can be cured by intervention. Currently there is considerable controversy over which method is best: that is conventional open surgery or endotherapy (techniques involving endoscopy). OBJECTIVES: We used data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the effectiveness of endotherapies compared with surgery in people with Barrett's oesophagus, those with early neoplasias (defined as high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and those with early cancer (defined as carcinoma in-situ, superficially invasive, early cancer or superficial cancer T-1m (T1-a) and T-1sm (T1-b)). SEARCH METHODS: We used the Cochrane highly sensitive search strategy to identify RCTs in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ISI Web of Science, EBMR, Controlled Trials mRCT and ISRCTN, and LILACS, in July and August 2008. The searches were updated in 2009 and again in April 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: RCTs comparing endotherapies with surgery in the treatment of high-grade dysplasia or early cancer. All cellular types of cancer were included (i.e. adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas and more unusual types) but will be discussed separately. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: patients of any age and either gender with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of early neoplasia (HGD and early cancer) in Barrett's or squamous lined oesophagus. Types of interventions; endotherapies (the intervention) compared with surgery (the control), all with curative intent. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Reports of studies that meet the inclusion criteria for this review would have been analysed using the methods detailed in Appendix 9. MAIN RESULTS: We did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria. In total we excluded 13 studies that were not RCTs but that compared surgery and endotherapies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This Cochrane review has indicated that there are no RCTs to compare management options in this vital area, therefore trials should be undertaken as a matter of urgency. The problems with such randomised methods are standardising surgery and endotherapies in all sites, standardising histopathology in all centres, assessing which patients are fit or unfit for surgery and making sure there are relevant outcomes for the study (i.e. long-term survival (over five or more years)) and no progression of HGD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Esophageal endoscopic ultrasound is now regarded as essential in the staging of esophageal carcinoma. There is an increasing trend toward endoluminal therapies (ie, endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation) for pre-cancer or early-stage cancers because of concerns of high morbidity associated with esophagectomy. This study reviews our institutional experience with preoperative endoscopic ultrasound staging of early esophageal cancers in patients who underwent an esophagectomy to evaluate the accuracy of staging by endoscopic ultrasound and how this affects treatment recommendations. METHODS: A prospective esophagectomy database of all patients undergoing an esophagectomy for esophageal cancer at a single high-volume institution was retrospectively reviewed for patients with early-stage esophageal cancer. This study analyzed patients with clinical Tis to T1 disease, as predicted by preoperative endoscopic ultrasound, and correlated this with the pathologic stages after esophagectomy. The surgical outcomes were evaluated to assess the safety of esophagectomy as a treatment modality. RESULTS: From 2005 to 2011, 107 patients (93 male, 14 female) with a mean age of 66 years (range, 39-91 years) were staged by preoperative endoscopic ultrasound to have esophageal high-grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or T1 cancer and underwent an esophagectomy. Tumor depth was correctly staged by endoscopic ultrasound in only 39\% (23/59) of pT1a tumors (invading into the lamina propria or muscularis mucosa) and 51\% (18/35) of pT1b tumors (submucosal). Of the endoscopic ultrasound-staged cT1a-lpN0 lesions, there were positive lymph nodes in 15\% of pathologic specimens (2/13). Patients with pT1a-mm lesions had a 9\% rate of pathologic lymph node involvement (1/11), and those with pT1b tumors had a 17\% rate of lymph node spread (6/35). Esophagectomy was performed in all 107 patients with a 30-day mortality rate of less than 1\% (1/107). CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic ultrasound for determining true pathologic staging are poor for early-stage esophageal cancers. Lesions thought to be cT1a-lpN0 by endoscopic ultrasound have at least pN1 disease in 15\% of cases. Endoluminal therapy of these lesions based on endoscopic ultrasound undertreats a significant number of patients. Esophagectomy is still the standard therapy for early-stage esophageal cancers in the majority of patients.},

However, in esophageal cancer patients the radiation dose to the heart is usually markedly higher. To determine whether radiation-induced cardiac toxicity is also a relevant issue for this group, we conducted a review of the current literature. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline for papers concerning cardiac toxicity in esophageal cancer patients treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall crude incidence of symptomatic cardiac toxicity was as high as 10.8\%. Toxicities corresponded with several dose-volume parameters of the heart. The most frequently reported complications were pericardial effusion, ischemic heart disease and heart failure. CONCLUSION: Cardiac toxicity is a relevant issue in the treatment of esophageal cancer. However, valid Normal Tissue Complication Probability models for esophageal cancer are not available at present.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Surgical stress in the presence of fasting worsens the catabolic state, causes insulin resistance and may delay recovery. Carbohydrate rich drinks given preoperatively may ameliorate these deleterious effects. A systematic review was undertaken to analyse the effect of preoperative carbohydrate loading on insulin resistance, gastric emptying, gastric acidity, patient wellbeing, immunity and nutrition following surgery. METHODS: All studies identified through PubMed until September 2011 were included. References were cross-checked to ensure capture of cited pertinent articles. RESULTS: Overall, 17 randomised controlled trials with a total of 1,445 patients who met the inclusion criteria were identified. Preoperative carbohydrate drinks significantly improved insulin resistance and indices of patient comfort following surgery, especially hunger, thirst, malaise, anxiety and nausea. No definite conclusions could be made regarding preservation of muscle mass. Following ingestion of carbohydrate drinks, no adverse events such as apparent or proven aspiration during or after surgery were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of oral carbohydrate drinks before surgery is probably safe and may have a positive influence on a wide range of perioperative markers of clinical outcome. Further studies are required to determine its cost effectiveness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the relation between hospital volume and surgical mortality is well established, for most procedures, the relative importance of the experience of the operating surgeon is uncertain. METHODS: Using information from the national Medicare claims data base for 1998 through 1999, we examined mortality among all 474,108 patients who underwent one of eight cardiovascular procedures or cancer resections. Using nested regression models, we examined the relations between operative mortality and surgeon volume and hospital volume (each in terms of total procedures performed per year), with adjustment for characteristics of the patients and other characteristics of the providers. RESULTS: Surgeon volume was inversely related to operative mortality for all eight procedures (P=0.003 for lung resection, P{$<$}0.001 for all other procedures). The adjusted odds ratio for operative death (for patients with a low-volume surgeon vs. those with a high-volume surgeon) varied widely according to the procedure--from 1.24 for lung resection to 3.61 for pancreatic resection. Surgeon volume accounted for a large proportion of the apparent effect of the hospital volume, to an extent that varied according to the procedure: it accounted for 100 percent of the effect for aortic-valve replacement, 57 percent for elective repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, 55 percent for pancreatic resection, 49 percent for coronary-artery bypass grafting, 46 percent for esophagectomy, 39 percent for cystectomy, and 24 percent for lung resection. For most procedures, the mortality rate was higher among patients of low-volume surgeons than among those of high-volume surgeons, regardless of the surgical volume of the hospital in which they practiced. CONCLUSIONS: For many procedures, the observed associations between hospital volume and operative mortality are largely mediated by surgeon volume. Patients can often improve their chances of survival substantially, even at high-volume hospitals, by selecting surgeons who perform the operations frequently.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Low muscle mass is present in approximately 40\% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and may be associated with poor outcome. We studied change in skeletal muscle during palliative chemotherapy in patients with mCRC and its association with treatment modifications and overall survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 67 patients with mCRC (mean age {$\pm$} standard deviation, 66.4 {$\pm$} 10.6 years; 63\% male), muscle area (square centimeters) was assessed using computed tomography scans of the third lumbar vertebra before and during palliative chemotherapy. Treatment modifications resulting from toxicity were evaluated, including delay, dose reduction, or termination of chemotherapy. Multiple regression analyses were performed for the association between change in muscle area and treatment modification and secondly overall survival. RESULTS: Muscle area of patients with mCRC decreased significantly during 3 months of chemotherapy by 6.1\% (95\% CI, -8.4 to -3.8; P {$<$} .001). Change in muscle area was not associated with treatment modifications. However, patients with muscle loss during treatment of 9\% or more (lowest tertile) had significantly lower survival rates than patients with muscle loss of less than 9\% (at 6 months, 33\% v 69\% of patients alive; at 1 year, 17\% v 49\% of patients alive; log-rank P = .001). Muscle loss of 9\% or more remained independently associated with survival when adjusted for sex, age, baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, comorbidity, mono-organ or multiorgan metastases, treatment line, and tumor progression at first evaluation by computed tomography scan (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95\% CI, 2.21 to 9.05; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: Muscle area decreased significantly during chemotherapy and was independently associated with survival in patients with mCRC. Further clinical evaluation is required to determine whether nutritional interventions and exercise training may preserve muscle area and thereby improve outcome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unlike for extremity sarcomas, the efficacy of radiotherapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma is not established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative radiotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone on abdominal recurrence-free survival. METHODS: EORTC-62092 is an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study done in 31 research institutions, hospitals, and cancer centres in 13 countries in Europe and North America. Adults (aged {$\geq$}18 years) with histologically documented, localised, primary retroperitoneal sarcoma that was operable and suitable for radiotherapy, who had not been previously treated and had a WHO performance status and American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 2 or lower, were centrally randomly assigned (1:1), using an interactive web response system and a minimisation algorithm, to receive either surgery alone or preoperative radiotherapy followed by surgery. Randomisation was stratified by hospital and performance status. Radiotherapy was delivered as 50{$\cdot$}4 Gy (in 28 daily fractions of 1{$\cdot$}8 Gy) in either 3D conformal radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy, and the objective of surgery was a macroscopically complete resection of the tumour mass with en-bloc organ resection as necessary. The primary endpoint was abdominal recurrence-free survival, as assessed by the investigator, and was analysed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was analysed in all patients who started their allocated treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01344018. FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2012 and April 10, 2017, 266 patients were enrolled, of whom 133 were randomly assigned to each group. The median follow-up was 43{$\cdot$}1 months (IQR 28{$\cdot$}8-59{$\cdot$}2). 128 (96\%) patients from the surgery alone group had surgery, and 119 (89\%) patients in the radiotherapy and surgery group had both radiotherapy and surgery. Median abdominal recurrence-free survival was 4{$\cdot$}5 years (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}9 to not estimable) in the radiotherapy plus surgery group and 5{$\cdot$}0 years (3{$\cdot$}4 to not estimable) in the surgery only group (hazard ratio 1{$\cdot$}01, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}71-1{$\cdot$}44; log rank p=0{$\cdot$}95). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were lymphopenia (98 [77\%] of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group vs one [1\%] of 128 patients in the surgery alone group), anaemia (15 [12\%] vs ten [8\%]), and hypoalbuminaemia (15 [12\%] vs five [4\%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 30 (24\%) of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group, and in 13 (10\%) of 128 patients in the surgery alone group. One (1\%) of 127 patients in the radiotherapy plus surgery group died due to treatment-related serious adverse events (gastropleural fistula), and no patients in the surgery alone group died due to treatment-related serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Preoperative radiotherapy should not be considered as standard of care treatment for retroperitoneal sarcoma.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to characterize enhancement of muscle and bone that occurs on standardized four-phase contrast-enhanced CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two musculoskeletal radiologists reviewed standardized four-phase abdominal CT scans obtained with IV contrast material. The psoas area was measured, and the mean attenuation (in Hounsfield units) was recorded for the aorta, psoas muscles, posterior paraspinal muscles, and L4 vertebral body. CT attenuation measures were compared between anatomic regions and imaging phases with the paired t test; associations between measures were examined with the Pearson correlation coefficient (R). RESULTS: The study included 201 patients (97 men, 104 women; mean age, 57.7 {$\pm$} 12.5 [SD] years). Subject age was inversely correlated with unenhanced attenuation in the psoas muscles, posterior paraspinal muscles, and L4 (p {$<$} 0.001). The psoas muscles, posterior paraspinal muscles, and L4 enhanced significantly (p {$<$} 0.001) at all three contrast-enhanced phases. The greatest muscle enhancement was observed on delayed phase scans, whereas the greatest enhancement in L4 was seen on portal phase imaging. The unenhanced attenuation of the psoas muscles was significantly and negatively correlated with enhancement of the psoas muscles at the portal and delayed phases (p {$<$} 0.05 and p {$<$} 0.01, respectively), but these correlations were not seen for the posterior paraspinal muscles. Age was positively correlated with posterior paraspinal muscle enhancement at the portal and delayed phases in men (p {$<$} 0.05 and p {$<$} 0.01, respectively) but not in women. CONCLUSION: Contrast enhancement of commonly measured muscle and bone regions is routinely observed and should be considered when using CT attenuation values as biomarkers of sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Furthermore, CT enhancement may be significantly influenced by age, sex, and unenhanced tissue attenuation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the association between muscle cross-sectional area and attenuation, as measured on routine CT scans, and mortality in older patients with hip fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective 10-year study of patients with hip fracture was conducted with the following inclusion criteria: age 65 years or older, first-time hip fracture treated with surgery, and CT of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. This yielded 274 patients (70.4\% women; mean [{$\pm$} SD] age, 81.3 {$\pm$} 8.3 years). On each CT scan, two readers independently measured the size (cross-sectional area, indexed for patient height) and attenuation of the paravertebral muscle at T12 and the psoas muscle at L4. We then determined the association between overall mortality and the muscle size and muscle attenuation, while adjusting for demographic variables (age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). RESULTS: The overall mortality rate increased from 28.3\% at 1 year to 79.5\% at 5 years. Mortality was associated with decreased thoracic muscle size (odds ratio [OR], 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.49-0.87). This association persisted after adjusting for demographic variables (OR, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.50-0.95), the ASA classification (OR, 0.70; CI, 0.51-0.97), and the CCI (OR, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.52-1.00). Similarly, decreased survival was associated with decreased thoracic muscle attenuation after adjusting for all of these combinations of covariates (OR, 0.67-0.72; 95\% CI, 0.49-0.99). Decreased lumbar muscle size and attenuation trended with decreased survival but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In older adults with hip fractures, CT findings of decreased thoracic paravertebral muscle size and attenuation are associated with decreased overall survival.},

  abstract = {Sarcopenia has recently emerged as a new condition that, independently from malnutrition, may adversely affect the prognosis of cancer patients. Purpose of this narrative review is to define the prevalence of sarcopenia in different primaries, its role in leading to chemotherapy toxicity and decreased compliance with the oncological therapy and the effect of some drugs on the onset of sarcopenia. Finally, the review aims to describe the current approaches to restore the muscle mass through nutrition, exercise and anti-inflammatory agents or multimodal programmes with a special emphasis on the results of randomized controlled trials. The examination of the computed tomography scan at the level of the third lumbar vertebra-a common procedure for staging many tumours-has allowed the oncologist to evaluate the muscle mass and to collect many retrospective data on the prevalence of sarcopenia and its clinical consequences. Sarcopenia is a condition affecting a high percentage of patients with a range depending on type of primary tumour and stage of disease. It is noteworthy that patients may be sarcopenic even if their nutritional status is apparently maintained or they are obese. Sarcopenic patients exhibited higher chemotherapy toxicity and poorer compliance with oncological treatments. Furthermore, several antineoplastic drugs appeared to worsen the sarcopenic status. Therapeutic approaches are several and this review will focus on those validated by randomized controlled trials. They include the use of {$\omega$}-3-enriched oral nutritional supplements and orexigenic agents, the administration of adequate high-protein regimens delivered enterally or parenterally, and programmes of physical exercise. Better results are expected combining different procedures in a multimodal approach. In conclusion, there are several premises to prevent/treat sarcopenia. The oncologist should coordinate this multimodal approach by selecting priorities and sequences of treatments and then involving a nutrition health care professional or a physical therapist depending on the condition of the single patient.},

METHODS: A series of 1410 subjects underwent major abdominal surgery for gastrointestinal cancer and received various types of nutritional support: standard intravenous fluids (SIF; n=149), total parenteral nutrition (TPN; n=368), enteral nutrition (EN; n=393), and immune-enhancing enteral nutrition (IEEN; n=500). Postoperative complications, considered as major (if lethal or requiring re-operation, or transfer to intensive care unit), or otherwise minor, were recorded. RESULTS: Major and minor complications occurred in 101 (7.2\%) and 446 (31.6\%) patients, respectively. Factors correlated with postoperative complications at multivariate analysis were pancreatic surgery, (p{$<$}0.001), advanced age (p=0.002), weight loss (p=0.019), low serum albumin (p=0.019) and nutritional support (p=0.001). Nutritional support reduced morbidity versus SIF with an increasing protective effect of TPN, EN, and IEEN. This effect remained valid regardless the severity of risk factors identified at the multivariate analysis and it was more evident by considering infectious complications only. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic surgery, advanced age, weight loss and low serum albumin are independent risk factors for the onset of postoperative complications. Nutritional support, particularly IEEN, significantly reduced postoperative morbidity.},

  abstract = {Objectives\hspace{0.6em} Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) is most often assessed in cancer patients on abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Abdominal CT imaging is not routinely performed in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Recently, a novel method to assess SMM on a single transversal CT slice at the level of the third cervical vertebra (C3) was published. The objective of this study was to assess the robustness of this novel C3 measurement method in terms of interobserver agreement. Patients and methods\hspace{0.6em} Patients diagnosed with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC) at our center between 2007 and 2011 were evaluated. Fifty-four patients with were randomly selected for analysis. Six observers independently measured the cross-sectional muscle area (CSMA) at the level of C3 using a predefined, written protocol as instruction. Interobserver agreement was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), a Bland\textendash Altman plot and Fleiss' kappa ({$\kappa$}). Results\hspace{0.6em} The agreement in vertebra selection between all observers was excellent (Fleiss' {$\kappa$}: 0.96). There was a substantial agreement between all observers in single slice selection (Fleiss' {$\kappa$}: 0.61). For all CSMA measurements, ICCs were excellent (0.763\textendash 0.969; all p\,{$<$}\,0.001). The Bland\textendash Altman plot showed good agreement between measurements, with narrow limits of agreement. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Interobserver agreement for SMM measurement at the level of C3 was excellent. Assessment of SMM at the level of C3 is easy and robust and can performed on routinely available imaging in HNC patients.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess whether a fully-automated deep learning system can accurately detect and analyze truncal musculature at multiple lumbar vertebral levels and muscle groupings on abdominal CT for potential use in the detection of central sarcopenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A computer system for automated segmentation of truncal musculature groups was designed and created. Abdominal CT scans of 102 sequential patients (mean age 68 years, range 59-81 years; 53 women, 49 men) conducted between January 2015 and February 2015 were assembled as a data set. Truncal musculature was manually segmented on axial CT images at multiple lumbar vertebral levels as reference standard data, divided into training and testing subsets, and analyzed by the system. Dice similarity coefficients were calculated to evaluate system performance. IRB approval was obtained, with waiver of informed consent in this retrospective study. RESULTS: System performance as gauged by the Dice coefficients, for detecting the total abdominal muscle cross-section at the level of the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, were, respectively, 0.953 {$\pm$} 0.015 and 0.953 {$\pm$} 0.011 for the training set, and 0.938 {$\pm$} 0.028 and 0.940 {$\pm$} 0.026 for the testing set. Dice coefficients for detecting total psoas muscle cross-section at the level of the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, were, respectively, 0.942 {$\pm$} 0.040 and 0.951 {$\pm$} 0.037 for the training set, and 0.939 {$\pm$} 0.028 and 0.946 {$\pm$} 0.032 for the testing set. CONCLUSION: This system fully-automatically and accurately segments multiple muscle groups at all lumbar spine levels on abdominal CT for detection of sarcopenia.},

  abstract = {Background: Body composition may partially explain the U-shaped association between body mass index (BMI) and colorectal cancer survival.Methods: Muscle and adiposity at colorectal cancer diagnosis and survival were examined in a retrospective cohort using Kaplan-Meier curves, multivariable Cox regression, and restricted cubic splines in 3,262 early-stage (I-III) male (50\%) and female (50\%) patients. Sarcopenia was defined using optimal stratification and sex- and BMI-specific cut points. High adiposity was defined as the highest tertile of sex-specific total adipose tissue (TAT). Primary outcomes were overall mortality and colorectal cancer-specific mortality (CRCsM).Results: Slightly over 42\% patients were sarcopenic. During 5.8 years of follow-up, 788 deaths occurred, including 433 from colorectal cancer. Sarcopenic patients had a 27\% [HR, 1.27; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.48] higher risk of overall mortality than those who were not sarcopenic. Females with both low muscle and high adiposity had a 64\% higher risk of overall mortality (HR, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.05-2.57) than females with adequate muscle and lower adiposity. The lowest risk of overall mortality was seen in patients with a BMI between 25 and {$<$}30 kg/m2, a range associated with the greatest number of patients (58.6\%) who were not at increased risk of overall mortality due to either low muscle or high adiposity.Conclusions: Sarcopenia is prevalent among patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer, and should, along with adiposity be a standard oncological marker.Impact: Our findings suggest a biologic explanation for the obesity paradox in colorectal cancer and refute the notion that the association between overweight and lower mortality is due solely to methodologic biases.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been developed to overcome the limitations of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). We aimed to compare the outcomes of these two methods. METHODS: Databases, including Pubmed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library, were searched to identify studies comparing ESD with EMR for premalignant and malignant lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. In a meta-analysis, primary end points were the en bloc resection rate and the curative resection rate; secondary end points were operation time, and rates of bleeding, perforation, and local recurrence. RESULTS: 15 nonrandomized studies (seven full-text and eight abstracts) were identified. Meta-analysis showed higher en bloc and curative resection rates (odds ratio [OR] 13.87, 95 \%CI 10.12 - 18.99; OR 3.53, 95 \%CI 2.57 - 4.84) irrespective of lesion size. Subgroup analysis showed higher en bloc and curative resection rates with ESD for esophageal, gastric, and colorectal neoplasms, and for lesions of size {$<$} 10 mm, 10 mm {$<$} 20 mm, and {$>$} 20 mm. Local recurrence was lower with ESD (OR 0.09, 95 \%CI 0.04 - 0.18). But ESD was more time-consuming than EMR (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.76; 95 \%CI 0.60 - 2.92), and showed high procedure-related bleeding and perforation rates (OR 2.20, 95 \%CI 1.58 - 3.07; OR 4.09, 95 \%CI 2.47 - 6.80). CONCLUSIONS: ESD showed better en bloc and curative resection rates and local recurrence compared with EMR, but was more time-consuming and had higher rates of bleeding and perforation complications. These results need to be confirmed by high quality trials and further studies in the west.},

Early oral feeding is safe and effective in recent randomized controlled trials in esophagectomy. This study assesses the implications of eliminating the insertion of jejunostomy after esophagectomy. METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken between 2014 and 2017 with follow-up over the first year. Fifty patients did not have a jejunostomy, compared with 46 patients who had conventional treatment. Outcomes measured included change in relative weight and body mass over 1 year, complications, and nutritional reinterventions. RESULTS: Median weight loss at 1 year was 10.7 kg (range, -8 to 55.6) whereas median percent weight loss was 12\% (range, -10.1\% to 39.2\%). Patients without jejunostomy lost more weight during the first month (P~= .002). Thereafter, at 6 of 12 months, there were no differences in actual or relative weight loss. Obese patients lost more weight in the group without jejunostomy compared with those who had it (9.9 versus 5 kg; P~= .004). This effect was not seen in normal or overweight patients. Complications were similar, whereas leaks were more common in the jejunostomy group (15.2\% versus 2\%; P~= .019). Nutritional reinterventions were similar during index admission and subsequent readmissions (7 versus 5 patients; P~= .640). CONCLUSIONS: Routine jejunostomy use delays rather than prevents weight loss after esophagectomy. Oral route nutrition allows patients to maintain sufficient nutrition and does not increase complications or requirement for nutritional interventions after surgery. Routine use of jejunostomy may not be required in modern practice.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Postoperative pulmonary complications can be a devastating consequence of surgery. Validated strategies to reduce these adverse outcomes are needed. OBJECTIVES: To design, implement, and determine the efficacy of a suite of interventions for reducing postoperative pulmonary complications. DESIGN: A before-after trial comparing our National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) pulmonary outcomes before and after implementing I COUGH, a multidisciplinary pulmonary care program. SETTING: An urban, academic, safety-net hospital. PARTICIPANTS: All patients who underwent general or vascular surgery at our institution during a 1-year period before and after implementation of I COUGH. INTERVENTIONS: A multidisciplinary team developed a strategy to reduce pulmonary complications based on comprehensive patient and family education and a set of standardized electronic physician orders to specify early postoperative mobilization and pulmonary care. Designated by the acronym I COUGH, the program emphasizes incentive spirometry, coughing and deep breathing, oral care (brushing teeth and using mouthwash twice daily), understanding (patient and family education), getting out of bed at least 3 times daily, and head-of-bed elevation. Nursing and physician education promoted a culture of mobilization and I COUGH interventions. I COUGH was implemented for all general surgery and vascular surgery patients at our institution in August 2010. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The NSQIP-reported incidence and risk-adjusted ratios of postoperative pneumonia and unplanned intubation, which NSQIP reports as observed-expected (OE) ratios for the 1-year period before implementing I COUGH and as odds ratios (ORs, statistically comparable to OE ratios) for the period after its implementation. RESULTS: Before implementation of I COUGH, our incidence of postoperative pneumonia was 2.6\%, falling to 1.6\% after its implementation, and risk-adjusted outcomes fell from an OE ratio of 2.13 to an OR of 1.58. The incidence of unplanned intubations was 2.0\% before I COUGH and 1.2\% after I COUGH, with risk-adjusted outcomes decreasing from an OE ratio of 2.10 to an OR of 1.31. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: I COUGH, a standardized postoperative care program emphasizing patient education, early mobilization, and pulmonary interventions, reduced the incidence of postoperative pneumonia and unplanned intubation among our patients.},

The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of patients who had clinical complete response(CR) with neoadjuvant CT-RT + oesophagectomy with the survival of patients who had clinical CR and were not operated on. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-seven consecutive patients with SCC of the thoracic oesophagus with CR with neoadjuvant CT-RT presenting at the Regional Center of Esophageal Diseases from 1992 to 2008 were included in this retrospective study on a prospectively collected database. Thirty-nine patients underwent oesophagectomy (CT-RT + oesophagectomy), while 38(CT-RT) were not operated on because they were considered unfit for surgery or refused the operation. Patients' outcome and survival were compared. RESULTS: In the CT-RT + oesophagectomy group, clinical CR was confirmed after histological examination of the surgical specimen in 27/39 (69.2 \%) patients. Five-year overall survival rates were 50.0 \% in the CT-RT + oesophagectomy group and 57.0 \% in the CT-RT group (p=0.99); 5-year disease-free survival rates were 55.5\%in the CT-RT + oesophagectomy group and 34.6\%in the CTRT group (p=0.15). Even after adjusting for propensity score, age, ASA and clinical stage, the treatment regimen did not show a statistically significant effect on overall survival (adjusted p=0.65) nor on disease-free survival (adjusted p=0.15). CONCLUSION: In our group of patients with clinical CR after neoadjuvant CT-RT for SCC of the thoracic oesophagus, waiting for recurrence and then using salvage surgery did not negatively impact their survival compared to patients treated with surgery. More accurate restaging protocols are warranted to improve decision making after CR with neoadjuvant CT-RT.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgical resection of the rectum is a standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. A subset of rectal cancer is caused by a deficiency in mismatch repair. Because mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer is responsive to programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade in the context of metastatic disease, it was hypothesized that checkpoint blockade could be effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient, locally advanced rectal cancer. METHODS: We initiated a prospective phase 2 study in which single-agent dostarlimab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, was administered every 3 weeks for 6 months in patients with mismatch repair-deficient stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma. This treatment was to be followed by standard chemoradiotherapy and surgery. Patients who had a clinical complete response after completion of dostarlimab therapy would proceed without chemoradiotherapy and surgery. The primary end points are sustained clinical complete response 12 months after completion of dostarlimab therapy or pathological complete response after completion of dostarlimab therapy with or without chemoradiotherapy and overall response to neoadjuvant dostarlimab therapy with or without chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients have completed treatment with dostarlimab and have undergone at least 6 months of follow-up. All 12 patients (100\%; 95\% confidence interval, 74 to 100) had a clinical complete response, with no evidence of tumor on magnetic resonance imaging, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emission tomography, endoscopic evaluation, digital rectal examination, or biopsy. At the time of this report, no patients had received chemoradiotherapy or undergone surgery, and no cases of progression or recurrence had been reported during follow-up (range, 6 to 25 months). No adverse events of grade 3 or higher have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: Mismatch repair-deficient, locally advanced rectal cancer was highly sensitive to single-agent PD-1 blockade. Longer follow-up is needed to assess the duration of response. (Funded by the Simon and Eve Colin Foundation and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04165772.).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many chemotherapy regimens dosed based on body surface area (BSA), patients experience dose reductions or delays or discontinue treatment, thereby reducing survival. Consideration of body composition may be useful in individualizing chemotherapy dosing, but to the authors' knowledge few studies to date have examined the association of body composition with chemotherapy tolerance in patients with colon cancer. METHODS: The authors identified patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer who were diagnosed from 2006 through 2011 at Kaiser Permanente and who received leucovorin calcium/calcium folinate, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as initial adjuvant chemotherapy (533 patients). Patients' muscle mass was quantified using clinically acquired computed tomography scans. The authors quantified chemotherapy doses, treatment dates, and related toxicities using the electronic medical record. In logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of disease, the authors examined associations of muscle tertiles with early treatment discontinuation ({$<$}6 cycles), treatment delay ({$>$}3 days off schedule for {$\geq$}3 times), and/or dose reduction (relative dose intensity\,{$\leq$}\,0.70, based on planned treatment). RESULTS: The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 58.7 years; BSA was 1.9\,m2 and body mass index was 28.7\,kg/m2 . Compared with the highest sex-specific tertile of muscle mass, patients in the lowest tertile were more likely to experience toxicities and had twice the risk of adverse outcomes while receiving FOLFOX; for early discontinuation, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.34 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.04-5.24; P for trend\,=\,.03), whereas the ORs were 2.24 (95\% CI, 1.37-3.66; P for trend\,=\,.002) for treatment delay and 2.28 (95\% CI, 1.19-4.36; P for trend\,=\,.01) for dose reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Lower muscle mass is associated with greater toxicity and poor chemotherapy adherence among patients receiving FOLFOX. Many chemotherapy drugs are dosed based on BSA, but treatment may be better individualized if muscle mass is considered. Cancer 2017;123:4868-77. \textcopyright{} 2017 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of body composition in cancer patients has been widely studied during the last decade. The main finding of these studies is that sarcopenia, or skeletal muscle depletion, assessed by CT imaging correlates with a reduced overall survival (OS). By contrast, the prognostic value of fat mass remains ill-defined. This study aims to analyze the influence of body composition including both muscle mass and adipose tissue on OS in a homogeneous population of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. METHODS: Among 235 patients with chemorefractory advanced CRC included in the SoMore and RegARd-C trials, body composition was assessed in 217 patients on baseline CT images. The relationship between body composition (sarcopenia, muscle density, subcutaneous and visceral fat index and density), body mass index (BMI) and OS were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients with a higher BMI had a better OS ({$\geq$}30 versus {$<$}\,30, HR: 0.50; 0.33-0.76). Those with low muscle index and muscle density had an increased mortality (HR: 2.06; 1.45-2.93 and HR: 1.54; 1.09-2.18, respectively). Likewise, low subcutaneous and visceral fat index were associated with an increased risk of dying (HR: 1.63; 1.23-2.17 and 1.48; 1.09-2.02 respectively), as were a high subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue density (HR: 1.93; 1.44-2.57 and 2.40; 1.79-3.20 respectively). In multivariate analysis, a high visceral fat density was the main predictor of poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the protective role of obesity in CRC patients at an advanced stage, as well as the negative prognostic impact of muscle depletion on survival. More importantly, our data show for the first time that visceral adipose tissue density is an important prognostic factor in metastatic CRC.

METHODS: In a multicentre, single-arm open study, patients with proved oesophageal cancer without definite distant metastases and regarded as suitable for potentially curative treatment were examined by PET. Clinicians were requested to supply a management plan before and another plan after being supplied with the PET scan results. Patients were followed for at least 1 year for outcome analysis. RESULTS: A total of 129 patients (104 men, mean age 67 y) were recruited. PET detected additional sites of disease in 53 patients (41\%). Significant changes in management (high or medium impact) were observed in 38\% of patients, primarily as a result of identifying additional sites of disease and/or confirming previously equivocal regional and distant metastases. Progression-free survival was significantly shorter in patients found to have additional lesions on PET (p {$<$} 0.05), but was not related to SUV(max). CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the significant impact of PET on the clinical management of patients with newly diagnosed oesophageal carcinoma, and on prognostic stratification of these patients.},

METHODS: The authors studied 235 consecutive patients with pretherapy clinical Stage II, III, or IVA (according to American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria) carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who were treated with chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy. Posttherapy cancer status was classified using pathologic stage and semiquantitative assessment of residual carcinoma. Clinicopathologic features, residual carcinoma status, and pretherapy and posttherapy stage were compared with disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: Posttherapy pathologic stage was Stage 0 in 29\% of patients, Stage I in 11\% of patients, Stage II in 34\% of patients, Stage III in 20\% of patients, and Stage IV in 6\% of patients. Cancer downstaging occurred in 56\% of patients. In univariate analysis, disease-free and overall survival were predicted by posttherapy pathologic stage (both with P {$<$} 0.001), margin status (P = 0.002 and P = 0.01, respectively), extent of residual carcinoma (both with P {$<$} 0.001), and downstaging (both with P = 0.001), but not by age, gender, type of cancer, pretherapy clinical stage, or preoperative regimen. However, in multivariate analysis, disease-free and overall survival were independently predicted by posttherapy pathologic stage (both with P = 0.02). Extent of residual carcinoma was a marginally significant predictor of overall survival (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Posttherapy pathologic stage was the best available predictor of outcome for patients with locoregional carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction who underwent chemoradiation therapy followed by esophagectomy. The findings in the current study supported the concept of downstaging by preoperative therapy.},

From July 2000 to December 2004, 80 patients with potentially resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the mid or lower thoracic esophagus were randomized to esophagectomy or chemoradiotherapy. A two-or three-stage esophagectomy with two-field dissection was performed. Patients treated with chemoradiotherapy received continuous 5-.uorouracil infusion (200 mg/m2/day) from day 1 to 42 and cisplatin (60 mg/m2) on days 1 and 22. The tumor and regional lymphatics were concomitantly irradiated to a total of 50\textendash 60 Gy.Tumor response was assessed by endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, and computed tomography scan. Salvage esophagectomy was performed for incomplete response or recurrence. Forty-four patients received standard esophagectomy, whereas 36 were treated with chemoradiotherapy. Median follow-up was 16.9 months. The operative mortality was 6.8\%. The incidence of postoperative complications was 38.6\%. No difference in the early cumulative survival was found between the two groups (RR = 0.89; 95\% confidence interval, 0.37-2.17; log-rank test P =0.45). There was no difference in the disease-free survival. Patients treated with surgery had a slightly higher proportion of recurrence in the mediastinum, whereas those treated with chemoradiation sustained a higher proportion of recurrence in the cervical or abdominal regions. Standard esophagectomy or chemoradiotherapy offered similar early clinical outcome and survival for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. The challenge lies in the detection of residue disease after chemoradiotherapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle dysfunction is a prevalent phenomenon in the oncology setting where patients across a wide range of diagnoses are subject to impaired muscle function regardless of tumor stage and nutritional state. Here, we review the current evidence describing the degree, causes and clinical implications of muscle dysfunction in cancer patients. The efficacy of exercise training to prevent and/or mitigate cancer-related muscle dysfunction is also discussed. DESIGN: We identified 194 studies examining muscular outcomes in cancer patients by searching PubMed and EMBASE databases. RESULTS: Muscle dysfunction is evident across all stages of the cancer trajectory. The causes of cancer-related muscle dysfunction are complex, but may involve a wide range of tumor-, therapy- and/or lifestyle-related factors, depending on the clinical setting of the individual patient. The main importance of muscle dysfunction in cancer patients lies in the correlation to vital clinical end points such as cancer-specific and all-cause mortality, therapy complications and quality of life (QoL). Such associations strongly emphasize the need for effective therapeutic countermeasures to be developed and implemented in oncology practice. Significant progress has been made over the last decade in the field of exercise oncology, indicating that exercise training constitutes a potent modulator of skeletal muscle function in patients with cancer. CONCLUSION: There are clear associations between muscle dysfunction and critical clinical end points. Yet there is a discrepancy between timing of exercise intervention trials, which can improve muscle function, and study populations in whom muscle function are proven prognostic important for clinical end points. Thus, future exercise trials should in early-stage patients, be powered to evaluate clinical outcomes associated with improvements in muscle function, or be promoted in advanced stage settings, aiming to reverse cancer-related muscle dysfunction, and thus potentially improve time-to-progression, treatment toxicity and survival.},

Eligible patients were adults aged 18-75 years and had newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven, rectal adenocarcinoma staged cT3 or cT4 M0, with a WHO performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group or standard-of-care group, using an independent web-based system by minimisation method stratified by centre, extramural extension of the tumour into perirectal fat according to MRI, tumour location, and stage. Investigators and participants were not masked to treatment allocation. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy group received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, irinotecan 180 mg/m2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 intravenously every 14 days for 6 cycles), chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy during 5 weeks and 800 mg/m2 concurrent oral capecitabine twice daily for 5 days per week), total mesorectal excision, and adjuvant chemotherapy (3 months of modified FOLFOX6 [intravenous oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 and leucovorin 400 mg/m2, followed by intravenous 400 mg/m2 fluorouracil bolus and then continuous infusion at a dose of 2400 mg/m2 over 46 h every 14 days for six cycles] or capecitabine [1250 mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1-14 every 21 days]). The standard-of-care group received chemoradiotherapy, total mesorectal excision, and adjuvant chemotherapy (for 6 months). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population at 3 years. Safety analyses were done on treated patients. This trial was registered with EudraCT (2011-004406-25) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01804790) and is now complete. FINDINGS: Between June 5, 2012, and June 26, 2017, 461 patients were randomly assigned to either the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (n=231) or the standard-of-care group (n=230). At a median follow-up of 46{$\cdot$}5 months (IQR 35{$\cdot$}4-61{$\cdot$}6), 3-year disease-free survival rates were 76\% (95\% CI 69-81) in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 69\% (62-74) in the standard-of-care group (stratified hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}69, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}49-0{$\cdot$}97; p=0{$\cdot$}034). During neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (38 [17\%] of 225 patients) and diarrhoea (25 [11\%] of 226). During chemoradiotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse event was lymphopenia (59 [28\%] of 212 in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group vs 67 [30\%] of 226 patients in the standard-of-care group). During adjuvant chemotherapy, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were lymphopenia (18 [11\%] of 161 in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group vs 42 [27\%] of 155 in the standard-of-care group), neutropenia (nine [6\%] of 161 vs 28 [18\%] of 155), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (19 [12\%] of 162 vs 32 [21\%] of 155). Serious adverse events occurred in 63 (27\%) of 231 participants in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 50 (22\%) of 230 patients in the standard-of-care group (p=0{$\cdot$}167), during the whole treatment period. During adjuvant therapy, serious adverse events occurred in 18 (11\%) of 163 participants in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 36 (23\%) of 158 patients in the standard-of-care group (p=0{$\cdot$}0049). Treatment-related deaths occurred in one ({$<$}1\%) of 226 patients in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (sudden death) and two (1\%) of 227 patients in the standard-of-care group (one sudden death and one myocardial infarction). INTERPRETATION: Intensification of chemotherapy using FOLFIRINOX before preoperative chemoradiotherapy significantly improved outcomes compared with preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with cT3 or cT4 M0 rectal cancer. The significantly improved disease-free survival in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and the decreased neurotoxicity indicates that the perioperative approach is more efficient and better tolerated than adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, the PRODIGE 23 results might change clinical practice. FUNDING: Institut National du Cancer, Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, and R\&D Unicancer.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Esophageal cancer (EC) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. Mortality and disease stage at diagnosis are important indicators of improvements in cancer prevention and control. We examined United States trends in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) mortality and stage at diagnosis by race and ethnicity. METHODS: We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data to identify individuals with histologically confirmed EAC and ESCC between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 2016. For both EAC and ESCC, we calculated age-adjusted mortality and the proportion presenting at each stage by race/ethnicity, sex, and year. We then calculated the annual percent change (APC) in each indicator by race/ethnicity and examined changes over time. RESULTS: The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC\,=\,1.60, p\,=\,0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC\,=\,- 4.53, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSION: We found notable differences in trends in EAC and ESCC mortality and stage at diagnosis by race/ethnicity. Stage migration resulting from improvements in diagnosis and treatment may partially explain recent trends in disease stage at diagnosis. Future efforts should identify factors driving current esophageal cancer disparities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The goal of treatment for Barrett's esophagus (BE) with dysplasia is complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM). The long-term durability of CEIM has not been well characterized, so the frequency and duration of surveillance are unclear. We report results from a 5-year follow-up analysis of patients with BE and dysplasia treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the randomized controlled Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia Containing Dysplasia (AIM) trial. METHODS: Participants for the AIM Dysplasia trial (18-80 years old) were recruited from 19 sites in the United States and had endoscopic evidence of non-nodular dysplastic BE {$\leq$}8~cm in length. Subjects (n~= 127) were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive either RFA (entire BE segment ablated circumferentially) or a sham endoscopic procedure; patients in the sham group were offered RFA treatment 1 year later, and all patients were followed for 5 years. We collected data on BE recurrence (defined as intestinal metaplasia in the tubular esophagus) and dysplastic BE recurrence among patients who achieved CEIM. We constructed Kaplan-Meier estimates and applied parametric survival analysis to examine proportions of patients without any recurrence and without dysplastic recurrence. RESULTS: Of 127 patients in the AIM Dysplasia trial, 119 received RFA and met inclusion criteria. Of those 119, 110 (92\%) achieved CEIM. Over 401 person-years of follow-up (mean, 3.6 years per patient; range, 0.2-5.8 years), 35 of 110 (32\%) patients had recurrence of BE or dysplasia, and 19 (17\%) had dysplasia recurrence. The incidence rate of BE recurrence was 10.8 per 100 person-years overall (95\% CI, 7.8-15.0); 8.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95\% CI, 4.9-14.0), and 13.5 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95\% CI 8.8-20.7). The incidence rate of dysplasia recurrence was 5.2 per 100 person-years overall (95\% CI 3.3-8.2); 3.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline low-grade dysplasia (95\% CI 1.5-7.2), and 7.3 per 100 person-years among patients with baseline high-grade dysplasia (95\%~CI 4.2-12.5). Neither BE nor dysplasia recurred at a constant rate. There was a greater probability of recurrence in the first year following CEIM than in the following 4 years combined. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of prospective cohort data from the AIM Dysplasia trial, we found BE to recur after CEIM by RFA in almost one third of patients with baseline dysplastic disease; most recurrences occurred during the first year after CEIM. However, patients who achieved CEIM and remained BE free at 1 year after RFA had a low risk of BE recurrence. Studies are needed to determine when surveillance can be decreased or discontinued; our study did not identify any BE or dysplasia recurrence after 4 years of surveillance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients often receive induction therapy based on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-identified nodal spread (N1) or deep tumor invasion (T3), although controversy exists regarding the role of induction therapy for early stage disease. We aim to evaluate the reliability of EUS in identifying early stage disease and the subsequent impact on treatment and outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 149 patients who underwent EUS and esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma between January 2000 and December 2008. Computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients, whereas positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in 91\%. Clinical stage (c), pathologic stage (p), operative mortality, and survival were recorded. RESULTS: Unanticipated pathologic nodal disease was similar in patients with cT1N0 and cT2N0 tumors (6/25 [24\%] versus 7/18 [38.8\%]; p=0.6). Among the 18 cases of cT2N0 disease, 9 (50\%) were pathologically staged as T1N0, 8 (44\%) were upstaged to pT3N0-1, and 1 (6\%) was pT2N0. One case of cT1N0 tumor (4\%) was upstaged to pT3N0. Among patients with cT1-2N0 tumors, 5-year disease-free survival for the group that was appropriately staged was 89.8\% versus 39.9\% for the group that had a higher pathologic stage than their clinical stage (ie, {$>$}T2N0) (p{$<$}0.001). Operative mortality for patients with cT1-2N0 tumors was 0/43 (0\%), which was no different from that in the higher clinical stage groups with (1/37, 2.7\%) or without (2/68, 2.9\%) induction therapy (p=0.5). Multivariate analysis identified marked/intense uptake on staging PET (odds ratio, 5.76, 95\%; confidence interval, 1.25 to 26.52; p=0.021) to be a factor predictive of upstaging of cT1-2N0 tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Current staging techniques are inadequate for predicting T1-2N0 disease in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Survival is excellent with operation alone in patients with tumors appropriately staged as T1-2N0, although patients with tumors upstaged to greater than T2N0 have significantly worse survival. Other preoperative factors such as PET uptake may help select patients with cT1-2N0 tumors that will be upstaged at resection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical staging of esophageal cancer has improved with positron-emission tomography/computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound imaging. Despite such progress, small single-center studies have questioned the reliability of clinical staging of T2 N0 esophageal cancer. This study broadly examines the adequacy of clinical staging of T2 N0 disease using The Society of Thoracic Surgeons database. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 810 clinical stage T2 N0 patients from 2002 to 2011, with 58 excluded because of incomplete pathologic staging data. Clinical stage, pathologic stage, and preoperative characteristics were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with upstaging at the time of surgical intervention. RESULTS: Among 752 clinical stage T2 N0 patients, 270 (35.9\%) received induction therapy before the operation. Of 482 patients who went directly to surgical intervention, 132 (27.4\%) were confirmed as pathologic T2 N0, 125 (25.9\%) were downstaged (ie, T0-1 N0), and 225 (46.7\%) were upstaged at the operation (T3-4 N0 or Tany N1-3). Exclusive tumor upstaging (ie, pathologic T3-4 N0) accounted for 41 patients (18.2\%), whereas exclusive nodal upstaging (ie, pathological T1-2 N1-3) accounted for 100 (44.5\%). Combined tumor and nodal upstaging (ie, pathological T3-4 N1-3) accounted for 84 patients (37.3\%). Among patients who received induction therapy, 103 (38.1\%) were upstaged vs 225 (46.7\%) without induction therapy (p = 0.026). Comparing the induction therapy group and the primary surgical group, postoperative 30-day mortality (3.7\% vs 3.7\%, p {$>$} 0.99) and morbidity (46.3\% vs 45\%, p = 0.76) were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in staging techniques, clinical staging of T2 N0 esophageal cancer remains unreliable. Recognizing T2 N0 as a threshold for induction therapy in esophageal cancer, many surgeons have opted to treat T2 N0 disease with induction therapy, even though one-quarter of these patients will be pathologic T1 N0. Although this study demonstrated similar perioperative morbidity and mortality with and without induction therapy, further study is needed to examine the effect of upstaging on long-term survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A regimen of epirubicin, cisplatin, and infused fluorouracil (ECF) improves survival among patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. We assessed whether the addition of a perioperative regimen of ECF to surgery improves outcomes among patients with potentially curable gastric cancer. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction, or lower esophagus to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (250 patients) or surgery alone (253 patients). Chemotherapy consisted of three preoperative and three postoperative cycles of intravenous epirubicin (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and cisplatin (60 mg per square meter) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (200 mg per square meter per day) for 21 days. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: ECF-related adverse effects were similar to those previously reported among patients with advanced gastric cancer. Rates of postoperative complications were similar in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and the surgery group (46 percent and 45 percent, respectively), as were the numbers of deaths within 30 days after surgery. The resected tumors were significantly smaller and less advanced in the perioperative-chemotherapy group. With a median follow-up of four years, 149 patients in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and 170 in the surgery group had died. As compared with the surgery group, the perioperative-chemotherapy group had a higher likelihood of overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.93; P=0.009; five-year survival rate, 36 percent vs. 23 percent) and of progression-free survival (hazard ratio for progression, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.81; P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with operable gastric or lower esophageal adenocarcinomas, a perioperative regimen of ECF decreased tumor size and stage and significantly improved progression-free and overall survival.

  abstract = {Objectives To determine the prevalence of low skeletal muscle mass in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and whether skeletal muscle mass measured from preoperative computed tomography (CT) images provides value in predicting postoperative length of stay (LOS). Background There are limited data on the use of body composition as a frailty measure in TAVR patients and no studies have determined if this measure predicts LOS. Methods We studied 104 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital from 2012 to 2016. Patient demographics, standard frailty measures (hand grip, albumin, and 5-m walk test), clinical comorbidities, echocardiographic data, and Valve Academic Research Consortium II major complications were recorded prospectively. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) [skeletal muscle mass cross-sectional area at L3/height2] was measured from CT images using Slice-O-Matic software (Tomovision, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Clinical outcomes were assessed and multivariate methods used to determine predictors of LOS. Results Sarcopenia was prevalent in men (83\%) and women (56\%). Patients who suffered from a major complication had significantly longer length of stay (13 vs 4.6 days, P b .0001). Skeletal muscle index correlated with age, sex, body mass index, handgrip strength, and previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but not major complications. A multivariate model including all univariate predictors of LOS showed SMI, major complications, transapical access, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome as independent predictors of LOS. For every 14-cm2/m2 increase in SMI, there was a 1-day reduction in LOS. None of the standard measures of frailty predicted LOS. Conclusions Skeletal muscle index, a measure of sarcopenia readily determined from pre-TAVR CT scans, independently predicts TAVR LOS better than standard frailty testing. Further evaluation of SMI as a frailty measure after TAVR and other cardiovascular procedures is warranted. (Am Heart J 2016;182:21-7.)},

Two hundred and twenty patients diagnosed with gastric/oesophageal cancer were studied. Patients underwent nutritional assessment consisting of calculation of body mass index, measurement of weight loss, dysphagia scoring and estimation of dietary intake. Serum acute-phase protein concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In all, 182 (83\%) patients had lost weight at diagnosis (median loss, 7\% body weight). Weight loss was associated with poor performance status, advanced disease stage, dysphagia, reduced dietary intake and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Multiple regression identified dietary intake (estimate of effect, 38\%), serum CRP concentrations (estimate of effect, 34\%) and stage of disease (estimate of effect, 28\%) as independent variables in determining degree of weight loss. Mechanisms other than reduced dietary intake or mechanical obstruction by the tumour appear to be involved in the nutritional decline in patients with gastro-oesophageal malignancy. Recognition that systemic inflammation plays a role in nutritional depletion may inform the development of appropriate therapeutic strategies to ameliorate weight loss, making patients more tolerant of cancer-modifying treatments such as chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Selection of patients for treatment of oesophagogastric cancers rests on accurate staging. Laparoscopy has become a safe and effective staging tool in upper gastrointestinal cancers because of its ability to detect small peritoneal and liver metastases missed by imaging techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of staging laparoscopy (SL) in determining resectability of oesophagogastric cancers. METHODS: A review of 511 patients with oesophagogastric cancers referred to our centre during a 7-year period was performed. Four hundred and sixteen of them assessed to have resectable tumours after preoperative staging with CT and/or ultrasound underwent SL. The main outcome measure was the number of patients in whom laparoscopy changed treatment decision. RESULTS: Staging laparoscopy changed treatment decision in 84 cases (20.2\%): locally advanced disease in 17, extensive lymph node disease in four and distant metastases (liver and peritoneum) in 63 cases. The sensitivity of laparoscopy for resectability was 88\%. Eighty-one percent of patients who had combined CT scan and EUS were resectable at surgery compared with 65\% of those who had CT scan alone (statistically significant with P-value{$<$}0.05). Of those patients deemed resectable by SL 8.1\% were found to be unresectable at laparotomy, 16 with locally advanced disease and 11 with metastases. CONCLUSION: Staging laparoscopy avoided unnecessary laparotomy in 20.2\% of our patients and was most useful in adenocarcinoma, distal oesophageal, GOJ and gastric cancers and probably not necessary in lesions of the upper two-third of the oesophagus.},

  abstract = {Background: The benefit of palliative chemotherapy (PC) in patients with advanced solid tumors and poor performance status (ECOG-PS) has not been prospectively validated, which makes treatment decision challenging. We aimed to evaluate the overall survival, factors associated with early mortality, and adoption of additional procedures in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer and poor ECOG-PS treated with PC. Methods: We analyzed a retrospective cohort of patients with advanced cancer treated with PC during hospitalization at an academic cancer center in Brazil from 2014 to 2016. Eligibility criteria included: ECOG-PS 3\textendash 4 and start of first-line PC; or ECOG-PS {$\geq$} 2 and start of second or subsequent lines. Primary endpoint was 30-day survival from start of PC. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival estimates and Cox regression for factors associated with 30-day mortality. Results: Two hundred twenty-eight patients were eligible. 21.9, 66.7 and 11.4\% of patients had ECOG-PS 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 49.6\% had gastrointestinal tumors. Median follow-up was 49 days (range 1\textendash 507). 98.2\% of patients had died, 32\% during the index hospitalization. The 30-day and 60-day survival rates were 55.7 and 38.5\%, respectively. 30\% of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. In a multivariable analysis, ECOG-PS 3/4 (HR 2.01; P = 0.016), hypercalcemia (HR 2.19; P = 0.005), and elevated bilirubin (HR 3.17; P {$<$} 0.001) were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. Conclusions: Patients with advanced cancer and poor ECOG-PS had short survival after treatment with inpatient PC. Inpatient PC was associated with aggressive end-of-life care. Prognostic markers such as ECOG-PS, hypercalcemia and elevated bilirubin can contribute to the decision-making process for these patients.},

The association of this adapted index with health outcomes and resource use was then examined with a sample of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent lumbar spine surgery in 1985 (n = 27,111). The index was associated in the expected direction with postoperative complications, mortality, blood transfusion, discharge to nursing home, length of hospital stay, and hospital charges. These associations were observed whether the index incorporated data from multiple hospitalizations over a year's time, or just from the index surgical admission. They also persisted after controlling for patient age.

In this study, quantitative body composition measurements using computed tomography (CT) were investigated in relation to survival, post-operative complications, and surgical site infections in surgical patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas. Methods A prospective cohort of 199 patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas was analysed by CT imaging at the L3 level to determine (i) muscle radiation attenuation (average Hounsfield units of total L3 skeletal muscle); (ii) visceral adipose tissue area; (iii) subcutaneous adipose tissue area; (iv) intermuscular adipose tissue area; and (v) skeletal muscle area. Sexspecific cut-offs were determined at the lower tertile for muscle radiation attenuation and skeletal muscle area and the higher tertile for adipose tissues. These variables of body composition were related to overall survival, severe post-operative complications (Dindo\textendash Clavien {$\geq$} 3), and surgical site infections (wounds inspected daily by an independent trial nurse) using Coxregression analysis and multivariable logistic regression analysis, respectively. Results Low muscle radiation attenuation was associated with shorter survival in comparison with moderate and high muscle radiation attenuation [median survival 10.8 (95\% CI: 8.8\textendash 12.8) vs. 17.4 (95\% CI: 14.7\textendash 20.1), and 18.5 (95\% CI: 9.2\textendash 27.8) months, respectively; P {$<$} 0.008]. Patient subgroups with high muscle radiation attenuation combined with either low visceral adipose tissue or age {$<$}70 years had longer survival than other subgroups (P = 0.011 and P = 0.001, respectively). Muscle radiation attenuation was inversely correlated with intermuscular adipose tissue (rp = \`A0.697, P {$<$} 0.001). High visceral adipose tissue was associated with an increased surgical site infection rate, OR: 2.4 (95\% CI: 1.1\textendash 5.3; P = 0.027). Conclusions Low muscle radiation attenuation was associated with reduced survival, and high visceral adiposity was associated with an increase in surgical site infections. The strong correlation between muscle radiation attenuation and intermuscular adipose tissue suggests the presence of ectopic fat in muscle, warranting further investigation. CT image analysis could be implemented in pre-operative risk assessment to assist in treatment decision-making.},

  abstract = {Background Palliative systemic treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic esophagogastric cancer may result in improved overall survival and quality of life but can also lead to considerable toxicity. In various cancer types, severe muscle mass depletion (sarcopenia) and poor muscle strength are associated with decreased survival and increased chemotherapy-related toxicity. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of body composition on survival and chemotherapy toxicity in esophagogastric cancer patients treated with first-line palliative chemotherapy. Methods A total of 88 patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer treated with standard first-line palliative systemic therapy consisting of capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapOx) between January 2010 and February 2017 were included. Skeletal muscle index (SMI), reflecting muscle mass, and skeletal muscle density (SMD), associated with muscle strength, were measured using pre-treatment of all patients and evaluation computed tomography scans after three treatment cycles of 65 patients and were used to determine sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (i.e. sarcopenia and body mass index {$>$}25 kg/m2). The associations between body composition (SMI, SMD, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity) and survival and toxicity were assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox and logistic regression analyses, respectively. Results Of 88 patients, 75\% was male, and median age was 63 (interquartile range 56\textendash 69) years. The majority of patients had an adenocarcinoma (83\%). Before start of treatment, 49\% of the patients were sarcopenic, and 20\% had sarcopenic obesity. Low SMD was observed in 50\% of patients. During three cycles CapOx, SMI significantly decreased, with a median decrease of 4\% (interquartile range -8.6\textendash -0.4). Median progression-free and overall survival were 6.9 and 10.1 months. SMI, SMD, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity (both pre-treatment and after three cycles) were neither associated with progression-free nor overall survival. Pre-treatment SMD was independently associated with grade 3\textendash 4 toxicity (odds ratio 0.94; 95\% confidence interval 0.89\textendash 1.00) and sarcopenic obesity with grade 2\textendash 4 neuropathy (odds ratio 3.82; 95\% confidence interval 1.20\textendash 12.18). Conclusions Sarcopenia was not associated with survival or treatment-related toxicity in advanced esophagogastric cancer patients treated with CapOx. Pre-treatment sarcopenic obesity was independently associated with the occurrence of grade 2\textendash 4 neurotoxicity and skeletal muscle density with grade 3\textendash 4 toxicity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The most recent systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the analgesic efficacy and side effects of paravertebral and epidural blockade for thoracotomy was published in 2006. Nine well-designed randomized trials with controversial results have been published since then. The present report constitutes an updated meta-analysis of this issue. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND: Thoracotomy is a major surgical procedure and is associated with severe postoperative pain. Epidural analgesia is the gold standard for post-thoracotomy pain management, but has its limitations and contraindications, and paravertebral blockade is increasingly popular. However, it has not been decided whether the analgesic effect of the two methods is comparable, or whether paravertebral blockade leads to a lower incidence of adverse side effects after thoracotomy. METHODS: Two reviewers independently searched the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (last performed on 1 February, 2013) for reports of studies comparing post-thoracotomy epidural analgesia and paravertebral blockade. The same individuals independently extracted data from the appropriate studies. RESULT: Eighteen trials involving 777 patients were included in the current analysis. There was no significant difference in pain scores between paravertebral blockade and epidural analgesia at 4-8, 24, 48 hours, and the rates of pulmonary complications and morphine usage during the first 24 hours were also similar. However, paravertebral blockade was better than epidural analgesia in reducing the incidence of urinary retention (p{$<$}0.0001), nausea and vomiting (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01), hypotension (p{$<$}0.00001), and rates of failed block were lower in the paravertebral blockade group (p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that PVB can provide comparable pain relief to traditional EPI, and may have a better side-effect profile for pain relief after thoracic surgery. Further high-powered randomized trials are to need to determine whether PVB truly offers any advantages over EPI.},

  abstract = {Malnutrition is common 1 year after esophageal cancer surgery. However, the prognostic impact of this malnutrition on long-term outcome has been poorly reported. This study aims at determining the potential effect on disease-free survival (DFS) of weight loss observed at 1 year in disease-free survivors after curative esophageal resection. From a prospective single-institution database, 304 patients having undergone a transthoracic esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy and gastric reconstruction between 1996 to 2008 were identified. Patients who died during the postoperative course (n= 24), patients who died within the first postoperative year (n= 12), patients who presented with an early recurrence within the first postoperative year (n= 20), and those who were lost to follow-up (n= 22) were excluded from the study, as well as those for whom the follow-up was shorter than 1 year (n= 21). The remaining 205 patients constituted a homogeneous group of 1-year disease-free survivors after full postoperative work-up and formed the material of the present study. Body weight (BW) values were collected before any treatment at the onset of symptoms (initial BW) and 1 year after esophagectomy. A 1-year weight loss (1-YWL) exceeding 10\% of the initial BW defined an important malnutrition. Impact of the 1-YWL{$\geq$} or \&lt;10\% of the initial BW on DFS was investigated. Logistic regression was performed to identify factors affecting DFS. The mean initial BW was 69.1 {$\pm$} 12{$\quad$}kg, corresponding to a mean body mass index (BMI) of 23.8 {$\pm$} 3{$\quad$}kg/m2. Preoperatively, 32 (15\%) patients were in the underweight category (BMI \&lt; 20{$\quad$}kg/m2), 110 (54\%) were in normal (BMI = 20\textendash 24{$\quad$}kg/m2), and 63 (31\%) were in the overweight category (BMI {$\geq$} 25{$\quad$}kg/m2). Mean 1-year BW was 63.5 {$\pm$} 12{$\quad$}kg. 1-YWL was \&lt;10\% of the initial BW in 92 patients (45\%) and {$\geq$}10\% in 113 patients (55\%). Accordingly, 5-year DFS rates were 66\% (median: 80 months) and 48\% (median: 51 months), respectively (P= 0.005). On multivariate analysis, only three independent variables affected the DFS significantly: clinical N stage (cN) status (P= 0.007; odds ratio: 1.99, 1.2\textendash 3.3), incomplete resection (P= 0.008, OR: 3.6, 1.3\textendash 9.3), and 1-YWL {$\geq$} 10\% (P= 0.004, OR: 2.1: 1.2\textendash 3.4). 1-YWL of or exceeding 10\% of the initial BW in 1-year disease-free survivors has a negative prognostic impact on DFS after esophagectomy for cancer. This information offers another view on the objectives of the perioperative nutritional care of these patients. Special vigilance program on the nutritional status in post-esophagectomy patients should be the rule.},

We reviewed a retrospective cohort of 27 patients treated at a single institution between 1999 and 2011. Clinical staging was performed with computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and endoscopic ultrasound. Patients were separated into two groups: neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery (NEOSURG) and surgery alone (SURG). There were 11 patients (41\%) in the NEOSURG group and 16 patients (59\%) in the SURG group. In the NEOSURG group, three of 11 patients (27\%) had a pathological complete response and eight (73\%) were partial or nonresponders after neoadjuvant therapy. In the SURG group, nine of 16 patients (56\%) were understaged, 6 (38\%) were overstaged, and 1 (6\%) was correctly staged. In the entire cohort, despite being clinically node negative, 14 of 27 patients (52\%) had node-positive disease (5/11 [45\%] in the NEOSURG group, and 9/16 [56\%] in the SURG group). Overall survival rate was not statistically significant between the two groups (P = 0.96). Many cT2N0 patients are clinically understaged and show no preoperative evidence of node-positive disease.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patterns of failure after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for esophageal cancer are poorly defined. METHODS: All patients in the current study were treated with trimodality therapy for nonmetastatic esophageal cancer from 1995 to 2009. Locoregional failure included lymph node failure (NF), anastomotic failure, or both. Abdominal paraaortic failure (PAF) was defined as disease recurrence at or below the superior mesenteric artery. RESULTS: Among 155 patients, the primary tumor location was the upper/middle esophagus in 18\%, the lower esophagus in 32\%, and the gastroesophageal junction in 50\% (adenocarcinoma in 79\% and squamous cell carcinoma in 21\%) of patients. Staging methods included endoscopic ultrasound (73\%), computed tomography (46\%), and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (54\%). Approximately 40\% of patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II disease and 60\% had stage III disease. The median follow-up was 1.3 years. The 2-year locoregional control, event-free survival, and overall survival rates were 86\%, 36\%, and 48\%, respectively. The 2-year NF rate was 14\%, the isolated NF rate was 3\%, and the anastomotic failure rate was 6\%. The 2-year PAF rate was 9\% and the isolated PAF rate was 5\%. PAF was found to be increased among patients with gastroesophageal junction tumors (12\% vs 6\%), especially for the subset with {$\geq$} 2 clinically involved lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis (19\% vs 4\%). CONCLUSIONS: Few patients experience isolated NF or PAF as their first disease recurrence. Therefore, it is unlikely that targeting additional regional lymph node basins with radiotherapy would significantly improve clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic eradication therapy is used to treat mucosal neoplasms in Barrett's esophagus, but cannot cure cancers that have metastasized to lymph nodes. The risk of such metastases has been proposed as a reason to consider esophagectomy rather than endoscopic therapy for esophageal mucosal neoplasia. The objective of our study was to determine the frequency of lymph-node metastases in patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: We performed a systematic review using the PRISMA guidelines to identify studies that included patients who had esophagectomy for HGD or intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus, and that reported final pathology results after examination of esophagectomy specimens. RESULTS: We identified 70 relevant reports that included 1,874 patients who had esophagectomy performed for HGD or intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Lymph-node metastases were found in 26 patients (1.39 \% , 95 \% CI 0.86 \textendash{} 1.92). No metastases were found in the 524 patients who had a final pathology diagnosis of HGD, whereas 26 (1.93 \% , 95 \% CI 1.19 \textendash{} 2.66 \%) of the 1,350 patients with a final pathology diagnosis of intramucosal carcinoma had positive lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of unexpected lymph-node metastases for patients with mucosal neoplasms in Barrett's esophagus is in the range of 1 \textendash{} 2 \%. Esophagectomy has a mortality rate that often exceeds 2 \%, with substantial morbidity and no guarantee of curing metastatic disease. Therefore, the risk of lymph node metastases alone does not warrant the choice of esophagectomy over endoscopic therapy for HGD and intramucosal carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus.},

In many cases, changes in muscle mass, particularly abdominal muscle, indicate how well a patient is responding to treatment. Therefore, physicians use CT to monitor changes in muscle mass throughout the patient's course of treatment. In order to measure the muscle, radiologists must segment and review each CT slice manually, which is a time-consuming task. In this work, we present a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) for the segmentation of abdominal muscle on CT. We achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.92, a mean precision of 0.93, and a mean recall of 0.91 in an independent test set. The CNN-based segmentation method can provide an automatic tool for the segmentation of abdominal muscle. As a result, the time required to obtain information about changes in abdominal muscle using the CNN takes a fraction of the time associated with manual segmentation methods and thus can provide a useful tool in the clinical application.},

During short-term starvation (first few days) the following differences are reported: hyperketonaemia is typically 2-fold greater in lean subjects, but associated with a 2-fold lower uptake of ketone bodies by forearm muscle; glucose tolerance becomes impaired more in lean subjects; and both protein turnover and leucine oxidation increase in the lean, but may show no significant change in the obese.

BACKGROUND: With improved oncologic outcomes in esophageal cancer, there is an increasing focus on functional status and health-related quality of life in survivorship. Early satiety and weight loss are common after esophagectomy, but the pathophysiology of these phenomena remains poorly understood. METHODS: In this prospective study, consecutive patients undergoing esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction were studied preoperatively and at 10 days, 6 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) immunoreactivity of plasma collected immediately before and at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes after a standardized 400-kcal mixed meal was determined. Gastrointestinal symptom scores were computed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires. RESULTS: Body weight loss at 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively among 13 patients undergoing esophagectomy was 11.1{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.3\% (P {$<$} 0.001) and 16.3{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.2\% (P {$<$} 0.0001), respectively. Early satiety (P = 0.043), gastrointestinal pain and discomfort (P = 0.01), altered taste (P= 0.006), and diarrhea (P= 0.038) scores increased at 3 months postoperatively. Area under the curve for the satiety gut hormone GLP-1 was significantly increased from 10 days postoperatively (2.4{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.2-fold increase, P {$<$} 0.01), and GLP-1 peak increased 3.8{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.6-, 4.7{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.8-, and 4.4{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.5-fold at 10 days, 6 weeks, and 3 months postoperatively (all P {$<$} 0.0001). Three months postoperatively, GLP-1 area under the curve was associated with early satiety (P = 0.0002, R = 0.74), eating symptoms (P = 0.007, R = 0.54), and trouble enjoying meals (P = 0.0004, R = 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: After esophagectomy, patients demonstrate an exaggerated postprandial satiety gut hormone response, which may mediate postoperative changes in satiety, body weight, and gastrointestinal quality of life.},

  abstract = {Purpose Racial/ethnic disparities in cancer survival in the United States are well documented, but the underlying causes are not well understood. We quantified the contribution of tumor, treatment, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors to racial/ethnic survival disparities in California. Materials and Methods California Cancer Registry data were used to estimate population-based cancer-specific survival for patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2000 and 2013 for each racial/ethnic group (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and separately each for Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) compared with non-Hispanic whites. The percentage contribution of factors to overall racial/ethnic survival disparities was estimated from a sequence of multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results In baseline models, black patients had the lowest survival for all cancer sites, and Asian American and Pacific Islander patients had the highest, compared with whites. Mediation analyses suggested that stage at diagnosis had the greatest influence on overall racial/ethnic survival disparities accounting for 24\% of disparities in breast cancer, 24\% in prostate cancer, and 16\% to 30\% in colorectal cancer. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was an important factor in all cancers, but only for black and Hispanic patients. The influence of marital status on racial/ethnic disparities was stronger in men than in women. Adjustment for all covariables explained approximately half of the overall survival disparities in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, but it explained only 15\% to 40\% of disparities in lung cancer. Conclusion Overall reductions in racial/ethnic survival disparities were driven largely by reductions for black compared with white patients. Stage at diagnosis had the largest effect on racial/ethnic survival disparities, but earlier detection would not entirely eliminate them. The influences of neighborhood socioeconomic status and marital status suggest that social determinants, support mechanisms, and access to health care are important contributing factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Black patients with esophageal cancer have worse survival than white patients. This study examines this racial disparity in conjunction with socioeconomic status (SES) and explores whether race-based outcome differences exist using a national database. METHODS: The associations between race and SES with overall survival of patients treated with esophagectomy for stages I to III esophageal cancer between 2003 and 2011 in the National Cancer Data Base were investigated using the Kaplan-Meier method and proportional hazards analyses. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. RESULTS: Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2\%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5\%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5\%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p {$<$} 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p~{$<$} 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. CONCLUSIONS: Prior studies have suggested that survival of esophageal cancer patients after esophagectomy is associated with race. Our study suggests that race is not significantly related to overall survival when adjusted for other prognostic variables. Socioeconomic status, however, remains significantly related to overall survival in our model.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Studies have reported potential underuse of surgical resection in black patients with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer. Our objective was to determine the independent, adverse effect of race on surgical resection, controlling for tumor location, comorbidity, and socioeconomic/insurance status. METHODS: All cases of nonmetastatic colon/rectal cancer reported to our state's Central Cancer Registry from 1996 to 2002 were identified and linked to Inpatient/Outpatient Surgery Files and the 2000 Census. Comorbidity (Deyo-Charlson Index) was calculated using ICD-9-CM codes and educational level/income were estimated at the zip code level. Characteristics between whites and blacks were compared using [chi]2 tests. Odds ratios (OR) of resection were calculated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We identified 5590/1932 white and 1906/466 black patients with colon/rectal cancer. Blacks were more likely to be younger, not married, rural, less educated, live in poverty, and uninsured/covered by Medicaid compared with whites (all P {$<$} 0.001). Underuse of surgery was far greater among blacks with rectal cancer (82.0\% vs. 89.3\% in whites, P{$<$} 0.001) compared with blacks with colon cancer (92.9\% vs. 94.5\% in whites, P {$<$} 0.001). After controlling for comorbidity/socioeconomic/insurance status and tumor location, the adjusted OR (95\% CI) for resection for blacks with colon cancer and blacks with rectal cancer living in poverty were 0.67 (0.51\textendash 0.88) and 0.20 (0.07\textendash 0.57), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Black race is a powerful, independent predictor of underuse of surgery in rectal cancer patients living in poverty. It is incumbent on the gastroenterology/surgical community to determine whether misperceptions about rectal surgery or barriers to successfully navigating multidisciplinary, rectal cancer care may account for these disparities.},

  abstract = {Background: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) has proposed using procedure-based hierarchical models to predict adverse outcomes, but it is not clear whether this approach was used to develop the NSQIP ``Surgical Risk Calculator''. We therefore wished to demonstrate how procedure-based hierarchical models can be constructed and to describe their results. Methods: NSQIP data from 2015 were used to construct statistical models predicting 30-day postoperative mortality and morbidity, using two-level logistic regression with preoperative patient-level variables as fixed effects and procedure-specific codes as a random intercept. Model performance was validated using NSQIP data from 2014. Results: NSQIP for 2015 contained records for 885,502 patients, of whom 8986 died (1.0\%) and 104,836 suffered a complication (11.8\%). Complete model specifications and results are presented, including odds ratios for patient-level variable effects and random procedure effects. Most comorbidities were associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but overweight and obesity were associated with lower risk. Odds ratios for individual procedures ranged from 0.117 to 10.85 for mortality and from 0.615 to 8.09 for morbidity. Validation C-statistics were 0.940 for the mortality model and 0.833 for the morbidity model; Brier Scores were 0.0086 and 0.085, respectively. Graphs for 20 quantiles showed good conformity of observed and predicted risk. Conclusions: Procedure-based hierarchical logistic regression models of NSQIP outcomes had satisfactory overall performance statistics. Model specifications and results are provided for criticism and improvement, and several possible refinements are suggested.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study was designed to assess the impact of age and comorbidity on choice and outcome of definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery. METHODS: In this population-based study, all patients with potentially curable EC (cT1N+/cT2-3, TX, any cN, cM0) diagnosed in the South East of the Netherlands between 2004 and 2014 were included. Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used to compare overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 702 patients was included. Age {$\geq$}\,75~years and multiple comorbidities were associated with a higher probability for dCRT (odds ratio [OR] 8.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 4.72-15.58; and OR 3.09; 95\% CI 1.93-4.93). The strongest associations were found for the combination of hypertension plus diabetes (OR 3.80; 95\% CI 1.97-7.32) and the combination of cardiovascular with pulmonary comorbidity (OR 3.18; 95\% CI 1.57-6.46). Patients with EC who underwent dCRT had a poorer prognosis than those who underwent nCRT plus surgery, irrespective of age, number, and type of comorbidities. In contrast, for patients with squamous cell carcinoma with {$\geq$}\,2 comorbidities or age {$\geq$}\,75~years, OS was comparable between both groups (hazard ratio [HR] 1.52; 95\% CI 0.78-2.97; and HR 0.73; 95\% CI 0.13-4.14). CONCLUSIONS: Histological tumor type should be acknowledged in treatment choices for patients with esophageal cancer. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus surgery should basically be advised as treatment of choice for operable esophageal adenocarcinoma patients. For patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with {$\geq$}\,2 comorbidities or age {$\geq$}\,75~years, dCRT may be the preferred strategy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older patients are often considered high-risk surgical candidates for locally advanced esophageal cancer, and the benefit of surgery in this population is unclear. This national analysis examines the effect of age on esophagectomy outcomes and compares surgery versus chemoradiation in older patients. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was used to identify patients with clinical stage II to III esophageal adenocarcinoma undergoing surgery or definitive chemoradiation between 2004 and 2015. Restricted cubic splines were used to examine the relationship between age and survival after esophagectomy, and maximally selected rank statistics were used to identify an age at which survival worsened. We used Cox proportional hazard models including an interaction term between age and treatment to compare overall survival, as well as survival of patients receiving esophagectomy versus definitive chemoradiation. RESULTS: Of 17,495 patients, 11,680 underwent esophagectomy and 5815 received chemoradiation. Survival after esophagectomy worsened with increasing age and decreased considerably after age 73 (hazard ratio~= 1.05, 95\% confidence interval, 1.04-1.06, per increasing year after 73 versus hazard ratio~= 1.01, 95\% confidence interval, 1.00-1.01, per increasing year to 73; both P {$<$} .001). Chemoradiation was increasingly used over surgery as age increased. The interaction between age and treatment was significant, and a graph of this interaction demonstrated a survival benefit for surgery over chemoradiation at most ages, including octogenarians. CONCLUSIONS: Survival worsens with age after esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal cancer. However, esophagectomy is associated with improved survival compared with definitive chemoradiation at most ages, including octogenarians. Esophagectomy may be considered over chemoradiation for patients who can tolerate surgery regardless of age.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many chemotherapy regimens dosed based on body surface area (BSA), patients experience dose reductions or delays or discontinue treatment, thereby reducing survival. Consideration of body composition may be useful in individualizing chemotherapy dosing, but to the authors' knowledge few studies to date have examined the association of body composition with chemotherapy tolerance in patients with colon cancer. METHODS: The authors identified patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer who were diagnosed from 2006 through 2011 at Kaiser Permanente and who received leucovorin calcium/calcium folinate, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as initial adjuvant chemotherapy (533 patients). Patients' muscle mass was quantified using clinically acquired computed tomography scans. The authors quantified chemotherapy doses, treatment dates, and related toxicities using the electronic medical record. In logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of disease, the authors examined associations of muscle tertiles with early treatment discontinuation ({$<$}6 cycles), treatment delay ({$>$}3 days off schedule for  3 times), and/or dose reduction (relative dose intensity   0.70, based on planned treatment). RESULTS: The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 58.7 years; BSA was 1.9 m2 and body mass index was 28.7 kg/m2. Compared with the highest sex-specific tertile of muscle mass, patients in the lowest tertile were more likely to experience toxicities and had twice the risk of adverse outcomes while receiving FOLFOX; for early discontinuation, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.34 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.04-5.24; P for trend 5 .03), whereas the ORs were 2.24 (95\% CI, 1.37-3.66; P for trend 5 .002) for treatment delay and 2.28 (95\% CI, 1.19-4.36; P for trend 5 .01) for dose reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Lower muscle mass is associated with greater toxicity and poor chemotherapy adherence among patients receiving FOLFOX. Many chemotherapy drugs are dosed based on BSA, but treatment may be better individualized if muscle mass is considered. Cancer 2017;123:4868-77. VC 2017 American Cancer Society.},

  abstract = {Importance: Systemic inflammation and sarcopenia are easily evaluated, predict mortality in many cancers, and are potentially modifiable. The combination of inflammation and sarcopenia may be able to identify patients with early-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) with poor prognosis. Objective: To examine associations of prediagnostic systemic inflammation with at-diagnosis sarcopenia, and determine whether these factors interact to predict CRC survival, adjusting for age, ethnicity, sex, body mass index, stage, and cancer site. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort of 2470 Kaiser Permanente patients with stage I to III CRC diagnosed from 2006 through 2011. Exposures: Our primary measure of inflammation was the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR). We averaged NLR in the 24 months before diagnosis (mean count\,=\,3 measures; mean time before diagnosis\,=\,7 mo). The reference group was NLR of less than 3, indicating low or no inflammation. Main Outcomes and Measures: Using computed tomography scans, we calculated skeletal muscle index (muscle area at the third lumbar vertebra divided by squared height). Sarcopenia was defined as less than 52 cm2/m2 and less than 38 cm2/m2 for normal or overweight men and women, respectively, and less than 54 cm2/m2 and less than 47 cm2/m2 for obese men and women, respectively. The main outcome was death (overall or CRC related). Results: Among 2470 patients, 1219 (49\%) were female; mean (SD) age was 63 (12) years. An NLR of 3 or greater and sarcopenia were common (1133 [46\%] and 1078 [44\%], respectively). Over a median of 6 years of follow-up, we observed 656 deaths, 357 from CRC. Increasing NLR was associated with sarcopenia in a dose-response manner (compared with NLR\,{$<$}\,3, odds ratio,\,1.35; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.67 for NLR 3 to {$<$}5; 1.47; 95\% CI, 1.16-1.85 for NLR\,{$\geq$}\,5; P for trend\,{$<$}\,.001). An NLR of 3 or greater and sarcopenia independently predicted overall (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.40-1.91 and HR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.53, respectively) and CRC-related death (HR, 1.71; 95\% CI, 1.39-2.12 and HR, 1.42; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.78, respectively). Patients with both sarcopenia and NLR of 3 or greater (vs neither) had double the risk of death, overall (HR, 2.12; 95\% CI, 1.70-2.65) and CRC related (HR, 2.43; 95\% CI, 1.79-3.29). Conclusions and Relevance: Prediagnosis inflammation was associated with at-diagnosis sarcopenia. Sarcopenia combined with inflammation nearly doubled risk of death, suggesting that these commonly collected biomarkers could enhance prognostication. A better understanding of how the host inflammatory/immune response influences changes in skeletal muscle may open new therapeutic avenues to improve cancer outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current information about outcomes in octogenarians undergoing cancer operations is limited largely to case series from selected centers. Population-based data can provide more realistic estimates of the risks and benefits of operations in this group. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing major resections for lung, esophageal, and pancreas cancer. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1994 to 2003), we examined operative mortality and discharge disposition in octogenarians (aged 80+ years), relative to younger patients (aged 65 to 69 years) (n = 272,662). We then used the Surveillance and End Results-Medicare-linked database (1992 to 2001) to measure late survival in the elderly (n = 14,088). RESULTS: Operative mortality among octogenarians was substantially higher than that of younger patients (aged 65 to 69 years) for all three cancers (esophagectomy, 19.9\% versus 8.8\%, p {$<$} 0.0001; pancreatectomy, 15.5\% versus 6.7\%, p {$<$} 0.0001; lung resection, 6.9\% versus 3.7\%, p {$<$} 0.0001). A large proportion of octogenarians were transferred to extended care facilities after operation, ranging from 24\% after lung resection to 44\% after esophagectomy. Five-year survival in octogenarians was low for all three cancers: 11\% after pancreatectomy, 18\% after esophagectomy and 31\% after lung cancer resection. Survival among octogenarians with two or more comorbidities was worse than those with fewer comorbid diagnoses--10\% versus 14\% for pancreatectomy, 15\% versus 23\% for esophagectomy, and 27\% versus 37\% for lung resection. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based outcomes after high-risk cancer operation in octogenarians are considerably worse than typically reported in case series and published survival statistics. Such information might better inform clinical decision making in this high-risk group.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: A prospective study of preoperative tumor-node-metastasis staging of patients with esophageal cancer (EC) was designed to compare the accuracy of 18-F-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) with conventional noninvasive modalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with carcinomas of the esophagus (n = 43) or gastroesophageal junction (n = 31) were studied. All patients underwent attenuation-corrected FDG-PET imaging, a spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, and an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). RESULTS: FDG-PET demonstrated increased activity in the primary tumor in 70 of 74 patients (sensitivity: 95\%). False-negative PET images were found in four patients with T1 lesions. Thirty-four patients (46\%) had stage IV disease. FDG-PET had a higher accuracy for diagnosing stage IV disease compared with the combination of CT and EUS (82\% v 64\%, respectively; P: =.004). FDG-PET had additional diagnostic value in 16 (22\%) of 74 patients by upstaging 11 (15\%) and downstaging five (7\%) patients. Thirty-nine (53\%) of the 74 patients underwent a 2- or 3-field lymphadenectomy in conjunction with primary curative esophagectomy. In these patients, tumoral involvement was found in 21 local and 35 regional or distant lymph nodes (LN). For local LN, the sensitivity of FDG-PET was lower than EUS (33\% v 81\%, respectively; P: =.027), but the specificity may have been higher (89\% v 67\%, respectively; P: = not significant [NS]). For the assessment of regional and distant LN involvement, compared with the combined use of CT and EUS, FDG-PET had a higher specificity (90\% v 98\%, respectively; P: =. 025) and a similar sensitivity (46\% v 43\%, respectively; P: = NS). CONCLUSION: PET significantly improves the detection of stage IV disease in EC compared with the conventional staging modalities. PET improves diagnostic specificity for LN staging.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of heart disease related death (HDRD) following radiation therapy (RT) for esophageal cancer (EC). METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, two cohorts of patients with EC were created: (I) patients who received RT with their initial therapy; and (II) those who did not. Heart disease specific survival (HDSS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional-hazards regression methods were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: We identified 40,778 patients with EC. A total of 26,377 patients received RT and 14,401 did not. HDSS analysis revealed increased risk of HDRD in those receiving RT (P{$<$}0.05), with an absolute risk of HDRD of 2.8\%, 5.3\% and 9.4\% at 5-, 10- and 20-year, respectively. Log rank test of HDSS revealed the risk of HDRD became significant at 8 months (P{$<$}0.05). The following were associated with HDRD: RT, age, race, stage at presentation, time period of diagnosis, and known comorbid condition keeping one from esophagectomy. On multivariate analysis, RT remained predictive of HDRD [hazard ratio (HR) 1.46, P{$<$}0.05]. When considering only candidates for definitive therapy, RT remained predictive of HDRD on univariate (HR 1.53, P{$<$}0.0001) and multivariate (HR 1.62, P{$<$}0.0001) analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The use of RT leads to increased risk of HDRD that is detectable as early as eight months from diagnosis. More research is needed to define optimal dose volume parameters to prevent cardiac death. Consideration should be given to this risk in relation to prognosis and the expected benefits of RT.},

Twelve healthy untrained volunteers (age range 60-72 yr) participated in a 12-wk strength training program (8 repetitions/set; 3 sets/day; 3 days/wk) at 80\% of the one repetition maximum (1 RM) for extensors and flexors of both knee joints. They were evaluated before the program and after 6 and 12 wk of training. Weekly measurements of 1 RM showed a progressive increase in strength in extensors and flexors. By 12 wk extensor and flexor strength had increased 107.4 (P less than 0.0001) and 226.7\% (P less than 0.0001), respectively. Isokinetic peak torque of extensors and flexors measured on a Cybex II dynamometer increased 10.0 and 18.5\% (P less than 0.05) at 60 degrees/s and 16.7 and 14.7\% (P less than 0.05) at 240 degrees/s. The torque-velocity relationship showed an upward displacement of the curve at the end of training, mainly in the slow-velocity high-torque region. Midthigh composition from computerized tomographic scans showed an increase (P less than 0.01) in total thigh area (4.8\%), total muscle area (11.4\%), and quadriceps area (9.3\%). Biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle revealed similar increases (P less than 0.001) in type I fiber area (33.5\%) and type II fiber area (27.6\%). Daily excretion of urinary 3-methyl-L-histidine increased with training (P less than 0.05) by an average 40.8\%. Strength gains in older men were associated with significant muscle hypertrophy and an increase in myofibrillar protein turnover.},

METHODS: CSA and SMD were computed on 216 axial CT images obtained at the L3 level in 72 patients with variations in IV contrast, slice thickness and tube current. Intra-patient mean difference (MD), 95 \% CI and limits of agreement were calculated using the Bland-Altman approach. Inter- and intra-analyst agreement was evaluated. RESULTS: IV contrast significantly increased CSA by 1.88 \% (MD 2.33 cm2; 95 \% CI 1.76-2.89) and SMD by 5.99 \% (p{$<$}0.0001). Five mm slice thickness significantly increased mean CSA by 1.11 \% compared to 2 mm images (1.32 cm2; 0.78-1.85) and significantly decreased SMD by 11.64 \% (p{$<$}0.0001). Low tube current significantly decreased mean CSA by 4.79 \% (6.44 cm2; 3.78-9.10) and significantly increased SMD by 46.46 \% (p{$<$}0.0001). Inter- and intra-analyst agreement was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: IV contrast, slice thickness and tube current significantly affect CSA and SMD. Investigators designing and analysing clinical trials using CT for body composition analysis should report CT acquisition parameters and consider the effect of slice thickness, IV contrast and tube current on myometric data. KEY POINTS: \textbullet{} Intravenous contrast, slice thickness and tube current significantly affect myometric data. \textbullet{} Image acquisition parameter variations may obscure intrapatient muscle differences on serial measurements. \textbullet{} Investigators using CT for body composition analysis should report CT acquisition parameters.},

  abstract = {Increased adiposity and its attendant metabolic features as well as systemic inflammation have been associated with prognosis in locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC). However, whether myosteatosis and its combination with systemic inflammatory markers are associated with prognosis of esophageal cancer is unknown. Our study aimed to investigate the influence of myosteatosis and its association with systemic inflammation on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in LAEC patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT). We retrospectively gathered information on 123 patients with LAEC submitted to dCRT at the University of Campinas Hospital. Computed tomography (CT) images at the level of L3 were analyzed to assess muscularity and adiposity. Systemic inflammation was mainly measured by calculating the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Median PFS for patients with myosteatosis (n = 72) was 11.0 months vs 4.0 months for patients without myosteatosis (n = 51) (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.83; P = .005). Myosteatosis was also independently associated with a favorable OS. Systemic inflammation (NLR {$>$} 2.8) was associated with a worse prognosis. The combination of myosteatosis with systemic inflammation revealed that the subgroup of patients with myosteatosis and without inflammation presented less than half the risk of disease progression (HR: 0.47; 95\% CI: 0.26-0.85; P = .013) and death (HR: 0.39; 95\% CI, 0.21-0.72; P = .003) compared with patients with inflammation. This study demonstrated that myosteatosis without systemic inflammation was independently associated with favorable PFS and OS in LAEC patients treated with dCRT.},

The aim of this study was to assess the physical performance and health related quality of life (HRQOL) of disease free survivors and compare findings in a case matched noncancer control group. Twenty-five males (mean ({$\pm$}SD) aged 63 ({$\pm$}6) years) who were over 6 months postesophagectomy and disease-free were compared with 25 controls (60 {$\pm$} 6 years). Physical functioning was assessed through hand grip strength (dynamometry), exercise capacity (incremental shuttle walk test), physical activity levels (RT3 accelerometer), and body composition (bio-electrical impedance analysis). Health-related quality of life was measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Esophageal cancer survivors demonstrated significantly lower fitness (P {$<$} 0.001) and time spent in moderate (P {$<$} 0.001) and vigorous (P {$<$} 0.001) intensity physical activity compared with controls. Global health status and quality of life were similar in both groups (P = 0.245); however, physical and role functioning domains were lower in the cancer survivors (P {$<$} 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively). These data show that disease-free survivors of curative esophageal cancer treatment demonstrate a significant compromise in physical functioning compared with controls, thus highlighting the multiple, complex rehabilitative needs of this cohort.},

OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and effectiveness of endoscopic circumferential balloon-based ablation by using radiofrequency energy for treating BE HGD. DESIGN: Multicenter U.S. registry. SETTING: Sixteen academic and community centers; treatment period from September 2004 to March 2007. PATIENTS: Patients with histologic evidence of intestinal metaplasia (IM) that contained HGD confirmed by at least 2 expert pathologists. A prior EMR was permitted, provided that residual HGD remained in the BE region for ablation. INTERVENTION: Endoscopic circumferential ablation with follow-up esophageal biopsies to assess the histologic response to treatment. OUTCOMES: Histologic complete response (CR) end points: (1) all biopsy specimen fragments obtained at the last biopsy session were negative for HGD (CR-HGD), (2) all biopsy specimens were negative for any dysplasia (CR-D), and (3) all biopsy specimens were negative for IM (CR-IM). RESULTS: A total of 142 patients (median age 66 years, interquartile range [IQR] 59-75 years) who had BE HGD (median length 6 cm, IQR 3-8 cm) underwent circumferential ablation (median 1 session, IQR 1-2). No serious adverse events were reported. There was 1 asymptomatic stricture and no buried glands. Ninety-two patients had at least 1 follow-up biopsy session (median follow-up 12 months, IQR 8-15 months). A CR-HGD was achieved in 90.2\% of patients, CR-D in 80.4\%, and CR-IM in 54.3\%. LIMITATIONS: A nonrandomized study design, without a control arm, a lack of centralized pathology review, ablation and biopsy technique not standardized, and a relatively short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic circumferential ablation is a promising modality for the treatment of BE that contains HGD. In this multicenter registry, the intervention safely achieved a CR for HGD in 90.2\% of patients at a median of 12 months of follow-up.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Prospective data on the efficacy of a watch-and-wait strategy to achieve organ preservation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with total neoadjuvant therapy are limited. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized phase II trial, we assessed the outcomes of 324 patients with stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma treated with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (INCT-CRT) or chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT) and either total mesorectal excision (TME) or watch-and-wait on the basis of tumor response. Patients in both groups received 4 months of infusional fluorouracil-leucovorin-oxaliplatin or capecitabine-oxaliplatin and 5,000 to 5,600 cGy of radiation combined with either continuous infusion fluorouracil or capecitabine during radiotherapy. The trial was designed as two stand-alone studies with disease-free survival (DFS) as the primary end point for both groups, with a comparison to a null hypothesis on the basis of historical data. The secondary end point was TME-free survival. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 3 years. Three-year DFS was 76\% (95\% CI, 69 to 84) for the INCT-CRT group and 76\% (95\% CI, 69 to 83) for the CRT-CNCT group, in line with the 3-year DFS rate (75\%) observed historically. Three-year TME-free survival was 41\% (95\% CI, 33 to 50) in the INCT-CRT group and 53\% (95\% CI, 45 to 62) in the CRT-CNCT group. No differences were found between groups in local recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, or overall survival. Patients who underwent TME after restaging and patients who underwent TME after regrowth had similar DFS rates. CONCLUSION: Organ preservation is achievable in half of the patients with rectal cancer treated with total neoadjuvant therapy, without an apparent detriment in survival, compared with historical controls treated with chemoradiotherapy, TME, and postoperative chemotherapy.},

We hypothesize that agerelated modifications of body composition (i.e. increased fat mass and decreased lean mass) may significantly affect tolerance to chemotherapy. Method: We conducted a systematic review for the last 25 years (between 1990 and 2015), using US National library of Medicine Medline electronic bibliographic database and Embase database of cohorts or clinical trials exploring (i) the interactions of body composition (assessed by Dual X-ray Absorptiometry, Bioelectrical Impedance Analyses, or Computerized Tomography) with pharmacokinetics parameters, (ii) the tolerance to chemotherapy, and (iii) the consequences of chemotherapies or targeted therapies on body composition. Results: Our search identified 1879 articles. After a selection (using pre-established criteria) on titles and abstract, 24 original articles were selected with 3 domains of interest: impact of body composition on pharmacokinetics (7 articles), relationship between body composition and chemotoxicity (14 articles), and effect of anti-cancer chemotherapy on body composition (11 articles). The selected studies suggested that pharmacokinetic was influenced by lean mass, that lower lean mass could be correlated with toxicity, and that sarcopenic patients experienced more toxicities that non-sarcopenic patients. Regarding fat mass, results were less conclusive. No studies specifically explored the topic of body composition in older cancer patients. Conclusions: Plausible pathophysiological pathways linking body composition, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics are sustained by the actual review. However, despite the growing number of older cancer patients, our review highlighted the lack of specific studies in the field of anti-neoplastic agents toxicity regarding body composition conducted in elderly.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Radiation therapy (RT) for esophageal cancer often results in unintended radiation doses delivered to the heart owing to anatomic proximity. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we examined late cardiac death in survivors of esophageal cancer that had or had not received RT. METHODS: 5,630 patients were identified that were diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma (AC) from 1973-2012, who were followed for at least 5 years after therapy. Examined risk factors for cardiac death included age ({$\leq$}55/56-65/66-75/{$>$}75), gender, race (white/non-white), stage (local/regional/distant), histology (SCC/AC), esophageal location ({$<$}18cm/18-24cm/25-32cm/33-40cm from incisors), diagnosis year (1973-1992/1993-2002/2003-2012), and receipt of surgery and/or RT. Time to cardiac death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox model was used to evaluate risk factors for cardiac death in propensity score matched data. RESULTS: Patients who received RT were younger, diagnosed more recently, had more advanced disease, SCC histology, and no surgery. The RT group had higher risk of cardiac death than the no-RT group (log-rank p{$<$}0.0001). The median time to cardiac death in the RT group was 289 months (95\% CI, 255-367) and was not reached in the no-RT group. The probability of cardiac death increased with age and decreased with diagnosis year, and this trend was more pronounced in the RT group. Multivariate analysis found RT to be associated with higher probability of cardiac death (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.03-1.47, HR 1.961, 95\% CI 1.466-2.624). Lower esophageal subsite (33-40 cm) was also associated with a higher risk of cardiac death. Other variables were not associated with cardiac death. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing the limitations of a SEER analysis including lack of comorbidity accountability, these data should prompt more definitive study as to whether a possible associative effect of RT on cardiac death could potentially be a causative effect.},

Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths for Black people in the United States and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence (herein through 2018), mortality (through 2019), survival, screening, and risk factors using population-based data from the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2022, there will be approximately 224,080 new cancer cases and 73,680 cancer deaths among Black people in the United States. During the most recent 5-year period, Black men had a 6\% higher incidence rate but 19\% higher mortality than White men overall, including an approximately 2-fold higher risk of death from myeloma, stomach cancer, and prostate cancer. The overall cancer mortality disparity is narrowing between Black and White men because of a steeper drop in Black men for lung and prostate cancers. However, the decline in prostate cancer mortality in Black men slowed from 5\% annually during 2010 through 2014 to 1.3\% during 2015 through 2019, likely reflecting the 5\% annual increase in advanced-stage diagnoses since 2012. Black women have an 8\% lower incidence rate than White women but a 12\% higher mortality; further, mortality rates are 2-fold higher for endometrial cancer and 41\% higher for breast cancer despite similar or lower incidence rates. The wide breast cancer disparity reflects both later stage diagnosis (57\% localized stage vs 67\% in White women) and lower 5-year survival overall (82\% vs 92\%, respectively) and for every stage of disease (eg, 20\% vs 30\%, respectively, for distant stage). Breast cancer surpassed lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among Black women in 2019. Targeted interventions are needed to reduce stark cancer inequalities in the Black community.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the general US population, blacks and whites have been shown to undergo colon cancer treatment at disproportionate rates. Accessibility to medical care may be the most important factor influencing differences in colon cancer treatment rates among whites and blacks. OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether racial disparities in colon cancer surgery and chemotherapy existed in an equal-access health care system. In addition, we sought to examine whether racial differences varied according to demographic and tumor characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING: Database research using the Department of Defense Military Health System. PATIENTS: Patients included 2560 non-Hispanic whites (NHW) and non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) with colon cancer diagnosed from 1998 to 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression was used to assess the associations between race and the receipt of colon cancer surgery or chemotherapy while controlling for available potential confounders, both overall and stratified by age at diagnosis, sex, and tumor stage. RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, the odds of receiving colon cancer surgery or chemotherapy for NHBs versus NHWs were similar (OR, 0.75 [95\% CI, 0.37-1.53]; OR, 0.79 [95\% CI, 0.59-1.04]). In addition, no effect modifications by age at diagnosis, sex, and tumor stage were observed. LIMITATIONS: Treatment data might not be complete for beneficiaries who also had non-Department of Defense health insurance. CONCLUSIONS: When access to medical care is equal, racial disparities in the provision of colon cancer surgery and chemotherapy were not apparent. Thus, it is possible that the inequalities in access to care play a major role in the racial disparities seen in colon cancer treatment in the general population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The preoperative period (prehabilitation) may represent a more appropriate time than the postoperative period to implement an intervention. The impact of prehabilitation on recovery of function al exercise capacity was thus studied in patients undergoing colorectal resection for cancer. METHODS: A parallel-arm single-blind superiority randomized controlled trial was conducted. Seventy-seven patients were randomized to receive either prehabilitation (n = 38) or rehabilitation (n = 39). Both groups received a home-based intervention of moderate aerobic and resistance exercises, nutritional counseling with protein supplementation, and relaxation exercises initiated either 4 weeks before surgery (prehabilitation) or immediately after surgery (rehabilitation), and continued for 8 weeks after surgery. Patients were managed with an enhanced recovery pathway. Primary outcome was functional exercise capacity measured using the validated 6-min walk test. RESULTS: Median duration of prehabilitation was 24.5 days. While awaiting surgery, functional walking capacity increased ({$\geq$} 20 m) in a higher proportion of the prehabilitation group compared with the rehabilitation group (53 vs. 15\%, adjusted P = 0.006). Complication rates and duration of hospital stay were similar. The difference between baseline and 8-week 6-min walking test was significantly higher in the prehabilitation compared with the rehabilitation group (+23.7 m [SD, 54.8] vs. -21.8 m [SD, 80.7]; mean difference 45.4 m [95\% CI, 13.9 to 77.0]). A higher proportion of the prehabilitation group were also recovered to or above baseline exercise capacity at 8 weeks compared with the rehabilitation group (84 vs. 62\%, adjusted P = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Meaningful changes in postoperative functional exercise capacity can be achieved with a prehabilitation program.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity, defined by body mass index (BMI), appears to have a paradoxical protective effect in several chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the obesity paradox in cancer patients by using body composition. DESIGN: The study was an observational study of 175 cancer patients assessed before chemotherapy. Obesity was defined as BMI (in kg/m(2)) {$\geq$}30 or fat mass index (FMI; fat mass divided by the square of height) {$\geq$}5.2 (men) and {$\geq$}8.2 (women) measured by using a bioelectrical impedance analysis. Low muscle mass (sarcopenia) was defined as fat-free mass index (fat-free mass divided by the square of height) {$<$}17.5 (men) and {$<$}15.1 (women). RESULTS: Most patients were women (65.7\%) and had a mean ({$\pm$}SD) age of 56.9 {$\pm$} 12.8 y. According to BMI criteria, 60\% of patients were overweight or obese. The median survival time for overweight (2.64 y; range: 0.23-3.16 y) and obese (2.61 y; range: 0.26-3.20 y) patients was significantly higher than for patients with a normal (2.04 y; range: 0.06-3.05 y) or low (0.52 y; range: 0.19-0.98 y) BMI (P {$<$} 0.001). Sarcopenic patients had shorter survival, regardless of their FMI. Obesity predicted higher survival rates only when sarcopenia was absent. In a multivariate Cox regression model, sarcopenia was an independent predictor of higher mortality (HR: 5.19; 95\% CI: 2.58, 10.43) after we controlled for BMI, age, and tumor stage. CONCLUSIONS: The obesity paradox is present in cancer patients only when obesity is defined by BMI. Patients with sarcopenic obesity had the poorest prognosis. Cancer patients with high mortality risk can be identified by a body-composition assessment.},

  abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) can yield quantitative imaging data from detailed maps of linear attenuation coefficients within tissue. The attenuation characteristics of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue can be quantified in vivo to provide information about the composition of skeletal muscle and the distribution of adipose tissue within muscle. Several studies have taken advantage of this utility to quantify skeletal muscle composition and fatty infiltration of muscle, in particular to quantify the attenuation characteristics of muscle as a marker of its lipid content. In this manner we found that the mean muscle attenuation of skeletal muscle reflects an increase in its fat content in obesity, and that this regional body composition parameter is strongly related to insulin-resistant glucose metabolism. In addition, muscle composition and adipose tissue distribution within muscle may be altered with clinical weight-loss interventions. CT may also provide important information about the changes in muscle mass and composition with aging and disease, which may, in turn, affect the muscle's function. In summary, CT can provide important quantitative data on the composition of muscle, and the distribution of adipose tissue within it, and this may be important in examining the relationships among skeletal muscle metabolism, lipid accumulation within muscle, and muscle function.},

METHODS: We developed recommendations for thromboprophylaxis in nonorthopedic surgical patients by using systematic methods as described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines. Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement. RESULTS: We describe several alternatives for stratifying the risk of VTE in general and abdominal-pelvic surgical patients. When the risk for VTE is very low ({$<$} 0.5\%), we recommend that no specific pharmacologic (Grade 1B) or mechanical (Grade 2C) prophylaxis be used other than early ambulation. For patients at low risk for VTE ({$\sim$}1.5\%), we suggest mechanical prophylaxis, preferably with intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), over no prophylaxis (Grade 2C). For patients at moderate risk for VTE ({$\sim$}3\%) who are not at high risk for major bleeding complications, we suggest low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (Grade 2B), low-dose unfractionated heparin (Grade 2B), or mechanical prophylaxis with IPC (Grade 2C) over no prophylaxis. For patients at high risk for VTE ({$\sim$}6\%) who are not at high risk for major bleeding complications, we recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH (Grade 1B) or low-dose unfractionated heparin (Grade 1B) over no prophylaxis. In these patients, we suggest adding mechanical prophylaxis with elastic stockings or IPC to pharmacologic prophylaxis (Grade 2C). For patients at high risk for VTE undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer, we recommend extended-duration, postoperative, pharmacologic prophylaxis (4 weeks) with LMWH over limited-duration prophylaxis (Grade 1B). For patients at moderate to high risk for VTE who are at high risk for major bleeding complications or those in whom the consequences of bleeding are believed to be particularly severe, we suggest use of mechanical prophylaxis, preferably with IPC, over no prophylaxis until the risk of bleeding diminishes and pharmacologic prophylaxis may be initiated (Grade 2C). For patients in all risk groups, we suggest that an inferior vena cava filter not be used for primary VTE prevention (Grade 2C) and that surveillance with venous compression ultrasonography should not be performed (Grade 2C). We developed similar recommendations for other nonorthopedic surgical populations. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal thromboprophylaxis in nonorthopedic surgical patients will consider the risks of VTE and bleeding complications as well as the values and preferences of individual patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate a fully automated abdominal CT-based muscle tool in a large adult screening population. METHODS: A fully automated validated muscle segmentation algorithm was applied to 9310 non-contrast CT scans, including a primary screening cohort of 8037 consecutive asymptomatic adults (mean age, 57.1{$\pm$}7.8 years; 3555M/4482F). Sequential follow-up scans were available in a subset of 1171 individuals (mean interval, 5.1 years). Muscle tissue cross-sectional area and attenuation (Hounsfield unit, HU) at the L3 level were assessed, including change over time. RESULTS: Mean values were significantly higher in males for both muscle area (190.6{$\pm$}33.6 vs 133.3{$\pm$}24.1 cm2, p{$<$}0.001) and density (34.3{$\pm$}11.1 HU vs 27.3{$\pm$}11.7 HU, p{$<$}0.001). Age-related losses were observed, with mean muscle area reduction of -1.5 cm2/year and attenuation reduction of -1.5 HU/year. Overall age-related muscle density (attenuation) loss was steeper than for muscle area for both sexes up to the age of 70 years. Between ages 50 and 70, relative muscle attenuation decreased significantly more in females (-30.6\% vs -18.0\%, p{$<$}0.001), whereas relative rates of muscle area loss were similar (-8\%). Between ages 70 and 90, males lost more density (-22.4\% vs -7.5\%) and area (-13.4\% vs -6.9\%, p{$<$}0.001). Of the 1171 patients with longitudinal follow-up, 1013 (86.5\%) showed a decrease in muscle attenuation, 739 (63.1\%) showed a decrease in area, and 1119 (95.6\%) showed a decrease in at least one of these measures. CONCLUSION: This fully automated CT muscle tool allows for both individualized and population-based assessment. Such data could be automatically derived at abdominal CT regardless of study indication, allowing for opportunistic sarcopenia detection. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This fully automated tool can be applied to routine abdominal CT scans for prospective or retrospective opportunistic sarcopenia assessment, regardless of the original clinical indication. Mean values were significantly higher in males for both muscle area and muscle density. Overall age-related muscle density (attenuation) loss was steeper than for muscle area for both sexes, and therefore may be a more valuable predictor of adverse outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Body mass index (BMI) has been associated with a risk of esophageal cancer. However, the influence of BMI and BMI loss on people with esophageal cancer that were treated with different therapies has not been described in China. Methods: In total, 615 consecutive patients that underwent esophagectomy and/or chemotherapy/radiotherapy were classified according to the Asian-specific BMI (kg/m2) cutoff values. The impact of BMI and BMI loss on long-term overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Multivariate analysis showed that overweight and obese patients had a more favorable survival than normal weight and underweight patients (p=0.017). Patients with a low BMI and high BMI loss before therapy had worse OS than others (p=0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with a high BMI were more likely to suffer hypertension (p{$<$}0.001) and receive only surgery (p{$<$}0.001), and they were less likely to be smokers (p=0.007) and anemic (p{$<$}0.001). Conversely, patients with high BMI loss were more likely to be anemic (p=0.001), to have advanced pathological stage (p=0.012), and to receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy (p=0.001). Moreover, the mortality rate was higher when patients had a high BMI loss. There is no survival benefit of higher BMI in the non-esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) group. Conclusion: Pretreatment BMI was an independent prognostic factor for long-term survival in esophageal cancer patients treated with different treatments. The overall survival was increased in esophageal cancer patients with a high pretreatment BMI and no BMI loss. There is no survival benefit of higher BMI in the non-ESCC group.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize utilization and survival outcomes associated with primary tumor-directed radiotherapy (PTDRT) in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic esophageal cancer. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study using the National Cancer Data Base to evaluate patients with newly diagnosed metastatic esophageal cancer between 2004 and 2012. Overall survival outcomes after treatment with chemotherapy plus conventional palliative dose radiotherapy ({$<$}5040 cGy), chemotherapy plus definitive dose radiotherapy ({$\geq$}5040 cGy), or chemotherapy alone were compared by using Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. Potential unmeasured confounding was assessed through sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 12,683 patients: 57\% were treated with chemotherapy alone, 24\% were treated with chemotherapy plus palliative dose radiotherapy, and 19\% were treated with chemotherapy plus definitive dose radiotherapy. Compared with chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy plus definitive dose radiotherapy was associated with improved survival (median overall survival of 8.3 versus 11.3 months [hazard ratio~= 0.72, 95\% confidence interval: 0.70-0.74, p {$\leq$} 0.001]), whereas chemotherapy plus palliative dose radiotherapy was associated with slightly inferior outcomes (median overall survival of 8.3 months versus 7.5 months (hazard ratio~= 1.10, 95\% confidence interval 1.07-1.13, p {$\leq$} 0.001). These findings were robust to potential unmeasured confounding in sensitivity analyses. Additionally, landmark analyses confirmed these findings in patients surviving 12 months or longer. CONCLUSIONS: Definitive dose, but not conventional palliative dose, PTDRT is associated with improved overall survival in metastatic esophageal cancer, suggesting that local control may be important to prognosis. These findings support integrating PTDRT into future clinical trials aimed at refining personalized treatment for patients with metastatic esophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or early neoplasia increasingly receive endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) therapy. We analyzed data from a UK registry that follows the outcomes of patients with BE who have undergone RFA for neoplasia. METHODS: We collected data on 335 patients with BE and neoplasia (72\% with HGD, 24\% with intramucosal cancer, 4\% with low-grade dysplasia [mean age, 69 years; 81\% male]), treated at 19 centers in the United Kingdom from July 2008 through August 2012. Mean length of BE segments was 5.8 cm (range, 1-20 cm). Patients' nodules were removed by endoscopic mucosal resection, and the patients then underwent RFA every 3 months until all areas of BE were ablated or cancer developed. Biopsies were collected 12 months after the first RFA; clearance of HGD, dysplasia, and BE were assessed. RESULTS: HGD was cleared from 86\% of patients, all dysplasia from 81\%, and BE from 62\% at the 12-month time point, after a mean of 2.5 (range, 2-6) RFA procedures. Complete reversal dysplasia was 15\% less likely for every 1-cm increment in BE length (odds ratio~= 1.156; SE~= 0.048; 95\% confidence interval: 1.07-1.26; P {$<$} .001). Endoscopic mucosal resection before RFA did not provide any benefit. Invasive cancer developed in 10 patients (3\%) by the 12-month time point and disease had progressed in 17 patients (5.1\%) after a median follow-up time of 19 months. Symptomatic strictures developed in 9\% of patients and were treated by endoscopic dilatation. Nineteen months after therapy began, 94\% of patients remained clear of dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: We analyzed data from a large series of patients in the United Kingdom who underwent RFA for BE-related neoplasia and found that by 12 months after treatment, dysplasia was cleared from 81\%. Shorter segments of BE respond better to RFA; http://www.controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN93069556.},

  abstract = {Recently, depletion of skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia) has been linked to poor prognosis in several types of cancers, but has not been investigated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This retrospective study investigates the relationship between sarcopenia and clinical outcome in ESCC patients treated by surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation therapy (dCRT). The study was retrospectively conducted in a single academic hospital in Kumamoto, Japan, and involved 325 ESCC patients (256 surgical cases and 69 dCRT cases) treated between April 2005 and April 2011. Skeletal muscle mass was quantified by radiologic measures using standard computed tomography scans. The skeletal muscle tissue in the 325 ESCC patients was distributed as follows: mean: 47.10; median: 46.88; standard deviation (SD): 7.39; range: 31.48\textendash 71.11; interquartile range, 46.29\textendash 47.90. Skeletal muscle tissue was greater in male patients than in female patients (P {$<$} 0.0001), but was independent of other clinical and tumor features. Sarcopenia was not significantly associated with overall survival (log rank P = 0.54). Lymph node involvement significantly altered the relationship between sarcopenia and survival rate (P for interaction = 0.026). Sarcopenia significantly reduced the overall survival of patients without lymph node involvement (log rank P = 0.035), but was uncorrelated with overall survival in patients with lymph involvement (log rank, P = 0.31). The anastomosis leakage rate was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group than in the non-sarcopenia group (P = 0.032), but other surgical complications did not significantly differ between the two groups. Sarcopenia in ESCC patients without lymph node involvement is associated with poor prognosis, indicating sarcopenia as a potential biomarker for identifying patients likely to experience an inferior outcome. Moreover, sarcopenia was associated with anastomosis leakage but no other short-term surgical outcome.},

We reviewed our institutional experience over 21~years (1990-2011) to determine clinical staging accuracy, optimal treatment approaches, and factors predictive of survival in this patient population. METHODS: Patients with cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer determined by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) were identified through a prospectively collected database. Demographics, perioperative data, and outcomes were examined. Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier plots were used for statistical survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 731 patients underwent esophagectomy, of whom 68 cT2N0M0 patients (9~\%) were identified. Fifty-seven patients (84~\%) had adenocarcinoma. Thirty-three patients (48.5~\%) were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery, and 35 underwent surgical resection alone. All resections except one included a transthoracic approach with two-field lymph node dissection. Thirty-day operative mortality was 2.9~\%. Only 3 patients (8.5~\%) who underwent surgery alone had T2N0M0 disease identified by pathology: the disease of 15 (42.8~\%) was found to be overstaged and 17 (48.5~\%) understaged after surgery. Understaging was more common in poorly differentiated tumors (p~=~0.03). Nine patients (27.2~\%) had complete pathologic response after chemoradiotherapy. Absence of lymph node metastases (pN0) was significantly more frequent in the neoadjuvant group (29 of 33 vs. 21 of 35, p~=~0.01). Median follow-up was 44.2~months. Overall 5-year survival was 50.8~\%. On multivariate analysis, adenocarcinoma (p~=~0.001) and pN0 after resection (p~=~0.01) were significant predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: EUS was inaccurate in staging cT2N0M0 esophageal cancer in this study. Poorly differentiated tumors were more frequently understaged. Adenocarcinoma and absence of lymph node metastases (pN0) were independently predictive of long-term survival. pN0 status was significantly more common in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, but long-term survival was not affected by neoadjuvant therapy. A strategy of neoadjuvant therapy followed by resection may be optimal in this group, especially in patients with disease likely to be understaged.},

  abstract = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

Chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (trimodality therapy) has not been widely adopted. The outcomes of patients undergoing dCRT or trimodality therapy at our cancer center between 2004 and 2012 were restrospectively analyzed. Trimodality therapy was offered to selected patients of good performance status (World Health Organisation performance status 0/1), with squamous cell carcinoma or bulky adenocarcinoma. dCRT was offered to patients of good PS but with comorbidities, upper third tumors or at patient's request. Patients received four cycles of chemotherapy with a platinum agent (mostly cisplatin) and a fluoropyrimidine (mostly 5-fluorouracil) over a total of 11 weeks. Cycles 3 and 4 were given concurrently with radiotherapy: 50 Gy in 25 fractions for dCRT and 45 Gy in 25 fractions in the trimodality group. Surgery occurred 8-10 weeks following the completion of chemoradiotherapy. The cut-off length for maximum gross tumor volume length was 10 cm. One hundred two patients were included (47 received dCRT, and 55 received trimodality treatment). The majority of tumors were stage III (80.4\%), and two-thirds were located in the distal esophagus (64.7\%). Median follow-up was 44 months. The 2-year overall survival (OS) was 57.3\% (median OS 39.7 months) for the dCRT group and 77.8\% (median not reached) for the trimodality group. The 5-year OS rates were 38\% and 58\%, respectively. Postoperative mortality rate was low at 1.8\%, and the pathological complete response rate was 23.6\%. In conclusion, trimodality treatment for patients with esophageal and junctional gastroesophageal tumors offers high rates of 2-year survival, and the potential for long-term cure. dCRT is an established alternative for patients that are not fit or suitable for surgery.},

We retrospectively studied SMD and SMI using computed tomographic (CT) scans in patients with gastric cancer receiving chemotherapy to evaluate its prognostic significance. SMD and SMI were obtained from CT-based analysis using Slice-O-Matic\textregistered{} medical imaging software in patients who received S-1 plus cisplatin chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer. The CT images taken within 1 month before starting chemotherapy were used. The cut-off values for determining low SMD [{$<$}33 Hounsfield units (HU) in obese and {$<$}41 HU in non-obese patients] and low SMI ({$<$}41 cm2/m2 in females, {$<$}43 cm2/m2 in non-obese males and {$<$}53 cm2/m2 in obese males) were referenced from a large population based study.

Patients with low SMD had significantly shorter OS compared with patients having normal SMD (8.9 vs. 12.8 months, P=0.03). However, OS did not differ significantly between patients with low and normal SMI (11.1 and 14.3 months, P= 0.18). Multivariate analyses confirmed that low SMD was an independent predictor of poor outcomes (P{$<$}0.01).

  abstract = {A 7 1/2-year consecutive series is presented from a district hospital with a policy of referring all rectal carcinomas to one surgical firm. The performance of lower anterior resections has limited the rate of abdominoperineal excision with permanent colostomy to 11\%. Of 115 patients in whom curative resection was attempted, 69 had anastomoses below 5 cm and 39 had mural resection margins of less than 2.5 cm. Surgical priority, however, was given to complete excision of the visceral rectal mesentery or mesorectum. At an average of 4.2 years postoperatively, three pelvic recurrences have developed but there have been no staple-line recurrences in patients who had "curative" surgery. The corrected cumulative probability of survival at 5 years is 87\% and the tumour-free survival by Dukes stage is A 94\%, B 87\%, and C 58\%. Patients with low tumours did no less well than those with high tumours, when treated by anterior resection. On this evidence, it is often safe to limit mural clearance and thus preserve the anal sphincters, provided that the mesorectum is excised intact with the cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically segment an axial CT image of the pelvis for body composition measures. We hypothesized that a deep CNN approach would achieve high accuracy when compared to manual segmentations as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We manually segmented 200 axial CT images at the supra-acetabular level in 200 subjects, labeling background, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), muscle, inter-muscular adipose tissue (IMAT), bone, and miscellaneous intra-pelvic content. The dataset was randomly divided into training (180/200) and test (20/200) datasets. Data augmentation was utilized to enlarge the training dataset and all images underwent preprocessing with histogram equalization. Our model was trained for 50 epochs using the U-Net architecture with batch size of 8, learning rate of 0.0001, Adadelta optimizer and a dropout of 0.20. The Dice (F1) score was used to assess similarity between the manual segmentations and the CNN predicted segmentations. RESULTS: The CNN model with data augmentation of N\,=\,3000 achieved accurate segmentation of body composition for all classes. The Dice scores were as follows: background (1.00), miscellaneous intra-pelvic content (0.98), SAT (0.97), muscle (0.95), IMAT (0.91), and bone (0.92). Mean time to automatically segment one CT image was 0.07~s (GPU) and 2.51~s (CPU). CONCLUSIONS: Our CNN-based model enables accurate automated segmentation of multiple tissues on pelvic CT images, with promising implications for body composition studies.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study is to assess CT-PET and endoscopic assessment postneoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in predicting complete pathologic response (pCR) in locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC). Design: A prospective cohort study. Background: nCRT is increasingly standard of care in LAEC, with pCR a surrogate for excellent outcome. Predicting pCR before surgery, with metabolic imaging and endoscopy, may spare patients' operative intervention. Methods: One hundred thirty-eight consecutive patients [mean age 61 \AE{} 8, 99 male (72\%), 103 (75\%) adenocarcinoma] underwent nCRT with CT-PET and endoscopy 4 to 6 weeks later, and surgery subsequently. A complete metabolic response (cMR) was defined as SUVmax of {$<$}4. A complete endoscopic response (cER) was no residual mucosal abnormality. The association of pCR with cMR and cER was analyzed. Results: pCR was achieved in 30 patients (22\%); 37\% SCC and 17\% adenocarcinoma. A cMR was evident in 63 (46\%), of whom 17 (27\%) had a pCR and 17(27\%) were ypN\th. A cER was observed in 45 (33\%). The Spearman correlation for cER and cMR was 0.066 (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.479), for cER and pCR was 0.004 (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.969), and cMR and pCR \textendash 0.120 (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.160). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of cMR was 57\%, 57\%, 27\%, and 82\%, respectively, and for combined cMR and cER was 24\%, 83\%, 28\%, and 79\%, respectively. Conclusions: The prediction of pCR through CT-PET and endoscopy independently or combined is limited by low sensitivity and poor positive predictive value. Protocols to avoid surgery in patients with apparent complete clinical complete based on these criteria should be adopted with considerable caution.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent randomized controlled trials comparing neoadjuvant chemoradiation plus surgery or perioperative chemotherapy plus surgery with surgery alone showed significant survival benefits for combined modality treatment of patients with localized esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, head-to-head comparisons of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and perioperative chemotherapy applying contemporary treatment protocols are lacking. The present trial was initiated to obtain valid information whether neoadjuvant chemoradiation or perioperative chemotherapy yields better survival in the treatment of localized esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS/DESIGN: The ESOPEC trial is an investigator-initiated multicenter prospective randomized controlled two-arm trial, comparing the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CROSS protocol: 41.4Gy plus carboplatin/paclitaxel) followed by surgery versus perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (FLOT protocol: 5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin/docetaxel) for the curative treatment of localized esophageal adenocarcinoma. Patients with cT1cN\,+\,cM0 and cT2-4acNxcM0 esophageal and junctional adenocarcinoma are eligible. The trial aims to include 438 participants who are centrally randomized to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio stratified by N-stage and study site. The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival assessed with a minimum follow-up of 36~months. Secondary objectives are progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival, site of failure, postoperative morbidity and mortality, duration of hospitalization as well as quality of life. DISCUSSION: The ESOPEC trial compares perioperative chemotherapy according to the FLOT protocol to neoadjuvant chemoradiation according to the CROSS protocol in multimodal treatment of non-metastasized recectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction. The goal of the trial is identify the superior protocol with regard to patient survival, treatment morbidity and quality of life. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02509286 (July 22, 2015).},

METHODS: Tumor lengths were examined retrospectively for 389 esophagectomy patients with respect to Endoscopy, EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound), CT and PET-CT, and pathology. Correlations between the measurements on the different approaches were assessed, and associations between tumor length and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Only the tumor lengths assessed on pathology were found to be significantly associated with overall (P\,=\,0.001) and recurrence free (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) survival on univariable analysis. The median overall survival was 47.1 months in those patients with tumor lengths {$<$}3.0\,cm, falling to 19.6 and 18.0 months in those with 3.0-4.4 and 4.5+\,cm tumors, respectively, demonstrating a reduction in patient survival at a tumor length of around 3\,cm. Tumor length on pathology was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation and both T- and N-categories. After accounting for these factors, tumor length on pathology was a significant independent predictor of recurrence-free (P\,=\,0.016), but not overall (P\,=\,0.128) survival. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor lengths on pathology were found to be the most predictive of patient outcome. However, after accounting for other tumor-related factors, tumor length only resulted in a marginal improvement in predictive accuracy.},

Overall, median progression-free survival and median survival time were 9.3 and 26.7 months, respectively. The median survival time was 27.5 months in the group treated with surgery with perioperative treatment, 50.6 months in those treated with surgery alone, and 22 months in the dCRT group.

Sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and visceral obesity (VO) have been identified as predictive of survival in colorectal cancer (CRC). We performed a systematic review of contemporary studies to characterize this association and highlight methodological inconsistencies. METHODS: MEDLINE and PubMed were queried for articles published from January 2000 on, with populations of resectable CRC and with CT-measured body composition and survival data. The study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Twenty studies met inclusion criteria, with a total of 8895 patients. Only two of the studies scored as high quality and nine as moderate quality. The remaining nine studies scored as low quality. Ten studies considered sarcopenia and 12 considered visceral obesity (VO). Cutoff points to define sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and VO were identified by optimal stratification, quartiles, or median values. The prevalence of sarcopenia varied from 15 to 60\%, which based on study population and cutoff value used. Sarcopenia was associated with worse overall and disease-free survival in eight of the included studies. Myosteatosis was considered in three studies with a prevalence of 19-78\%. It was significantly predictive of worse overall and disease-free survival in all three studies. VO had a prevalence of 14-70\% and was inconsistently predictive of survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of methodological consistency within the currently published literature. Despite this, sarcopenia and myosteatosis, but not VO, are consistently associated with worse survival outcomes, when population and cancer-specific cutoffs are utilized.},

However, these studies have been limited in their ability to assess whether the effects of obesity vary by gender or by the presence of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GERD) symptoms. METHODS: Individual participant data from 12 epidemiological studies (8 North American, 3 European and 1 Australian) comprising 1997 OA cases, 1900 OGJA cases and 11 159 control subjects were pooled. Logistic regression was used to estimate study-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) and the risk of OA and OGJA. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to combine these ORs. We also investigated effect modification and synergistic interaction of BMI with GERD symptoms and gender. RESULTS: The association of OA and OGJA increased directly with increasing BMI (P for trend {$<$}0.001). Compared with individuals with a BMI {$<$}25, BMI {$\geq$}40 was associated with both OA (OR 4.76, 95\% CI 2.96-7.66) and OGJA (OR 3.07, 95\% CI 1.89-4.99). These associations were similar when stratified by gender and GERD symptoms. There was evidence for synergistic interaction between BMI and GERD symptoms in relation to OA/OGJA risk. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that BMI is directly associated with OA and OGJA risk in both men and women and in those with and without GERD symptoms. Disentangling the relationship between BMI and GERD will be important for understanding preventive efforts for OA and OGJA.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: PD-1 blockade is highly effective in patients with mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high metastatic colorectal cancer. The role of single-agent PD-1 blockade in the neoadjuvant setting for resectable mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer remains unclear. We investigated the efficacy and safety of PD-1 blockade with toripalimab, with or without the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, as neoadjuvant treatment for mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancers. METHODS: The PD-1 Inhibitor in Microsatellite Instability Colorectal Cancer (PICC) trial was a single-centre, open-label, parallel-group, non-comparative, randomised, phase 2 study undertaken at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Eligible patients were aged 18-75 years, had histologically confirmed mismatch repair-deficient or microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer, had clinical stage T3-T4 or any T with lymph node positivity (N+), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1, and adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), without any stratification or balanced blocking, to receive toripalimab 3 mg/kg intravenously on day 1, with or without celecoxib 200 mg orally twice daily from day 1 to 14 of each 14-day cycle, for six cycles before surgical resection. Adjuvant treatment with toripalimab with or without celecoxib was permitted at the investigators' discretion. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with pathological complete response, defined as tumours without any viable tumour cells in the resected primary tumour sample and all sampled regional lymph nodes. All efficacy and safety analyses were assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomly assigned to treatment and who received at least one dose of toripalimab. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03926338, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2019, and April 1, 2021, 53 patients were screened, of whom 34 were randomly assigned to either the toripalimab plus celecoxib group (n=17) or the toripalimab monotherapy group (n=17). As of data cutoff (Aug 10, 2021), median follow-up was 14{$\cdot$}9 months (IQR 8{$\cdot$}8-17{$\cdot$}0). All patients received study treatment and underwent surgical resection; there were no treatment-related surgical delays. All 34 patients had an R0 resection ({$>$}1 mm resection margin). 15 of 17 patients (88\% [95\% CI 64-99]) in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and 11 of 17 patients (65\% [38-86]) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had a pathological complete response. All patients continued to receive adjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib for a total perioperative duration of 6 months and were alive and free of recurrence at data cutoff. During neoadjuvant treatment, ten (59\%) patients in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group and ten (59\%) in the toripalimab monotherapy group had grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events. Only one (3\%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab plus celecoxib group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse event during the neoadjuvant phase, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase levels. In the adjuvant phase, only one (3\%) of 34 patients, who was in the toripalimab monotherapy group, had a grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, which was grade 3 increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels. INTERPRETATION: Neoadjuvant toripalimab with or without celecoxib could be a potential therapeutic option for patients with mismatch repair deficient or microsatellite instability-high, locally advanced, colorectal cancer.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Post-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) FDG PET is a useful prognosticator of esophageal cancer. However, debate on the diverse criteria of previous publications preclude worldwide multicenter comparisons, and even a universal practice guide. We aimed to validate a simple qualitative interpretation criterion of post-CRT FDG PET for outcome stratification and compare it with other criteria. METHODS: The post-CRT FDG PET of 114 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were independently interpreted using a qualitative 4-point scale (Qual4PS) that identified focal esophageal FDG uptake greater than liver uptake as residual tumor. Cohen's {$\kappa$} coefficient ({$\kappa$}) was used to measure interobserver agreement of Qual4PS. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used for survival analysis. Other criteria included a different qualitative approach (QualBK), maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax3.4, SUVmax2.5), relative change of SUVmax between pre- and post-CRT FDG PET ({$\Delta$}SUVmax), mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean), metabolic volume (MV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). RESULTS: Overall interobserver agreement on the Qual4PS criterion was excellent ({$\kappa$}: 0.95). Except the QualBK, SUVmax2.5, and TLG, all the other criteria were significant predictors for overall survival (OS). Multivariable analysis showed only Qual4PS (HR: 15.41; P = 0.005) and AJCC stage (HR: 2.47; P = 0.007) were significant independent variables. The 2-year OS rates of Qual4PS(-) patients undergoing CRT alone (68.4\%) and patients undergoing trimodality therapy (62.5\%) were not significant different, but the 2-year OS rates of Qual4PS(+) patients undergoing CRT alone (10.0\%) were significantly lower than in patients undergoing trimodality therapy (42.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: The Qual4PS criterion is reproducible for assessing the response of ESCC to CRT, and valuable for predicting survival. It may add value to response-adapted treatment for ESCC patients, and help to decide whether surgery is warranted after CRT.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Controversy exists about the best surgical treatment for esophageal carcinoma. METHODS: We randomly assigned 220 patients with adenocarcinoma of the mid-to-distal esophagus or adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia involving the distal esophagus either to transhiatal esophagectomy or to transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en bloc lymphadenectomy. Principal end points were overall survival and disease-free survival. Early morbidity and mortality, the number of quality-adjusted life-years gained, and cost effectiveness were also determined. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were assigned to undergo transhiatal esophagectomy, and 114 to undergo transthoracic esophagectomy. Demographic characteristics and characteristics of the tumor were similar in the two groups. Perioperative morbidity was higher after transthoracic esophagectomy, but there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (P=0.45). After a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 142 patients had died--74 (70 percent) after transhiatal resection and 68 (60 percent) after transthoracic resection (P=0.12). Although the difference in survival was not statistically significant, there was a trend toward a survival benefit with the extended approach at five years: disease-free survival was 27 percent in the transhiatal-esophagectomy group, as compared with 39 percent in the transthoracic-esophagectomy group (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -1 to 24 percent [the negative value indicates better survival with transhiatal resection]), whereas overall survival was 29 percent as compared with 39 percent (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -3 to 23 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Transhiatal esophagectomy was associated with lower morbidity than transthoracic esophagectomy with extended en bloc lymphadenectomy. Although median overall, disease-free, and quality-adjusted survival did not differ statistically between the groups, there was a trend toward improved long-term survival at five years with the extended transthoracic approach.},

High body mass index (BMI) is a strong risk factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This study aimed to assess the impact of pre- and post-operative weight loss and BMI on long-term mortality after resection for oesophageal cancer. METHODS: This prospective and nationwide cohort study included 390 patients, operated on for oesophageal cancer in Sweden in 2001-2005 with follow-up until 2016, who responded to a questionnaire on weight history 6 months after surgery. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models provided hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) of mortality while adjusting for several prognostic factors, including tumour stage. RESULTS: Compared to weight stable patients, pre-surgery weight loss indicated increased HRs of overall all-cause mortality (HR~=~1.32, 95\% CI 0.94-1.86) and disease-specific mortality (HR~=~1.36, 95\% CI 0.93-1.98). Patients with {$>$}20\% weight loss post-surgery had worse overall all-cause mortality (HR~=~1.71, 95\% CI 1.01-2.88) and disease-specific mortality (HR~=~2.20, 95\% CI 1.24-3.89). Compared to patients with normal BMI, decreased HRs were indicated for patients who were obese at the time of surgery (overall all-cause mortality HR 0.87 95\% CI, 0.58-1.31 and disease-specific mortality HR~=~0.89, 95\% CI 0.57-1.40), while patients with BMI {$\leq$}19.9~at 6 months post-surgery had increased all-cause mortality (HR~=~1.41, 95\% CI 1.03-1.95) and disease-specific mortality (HR~=~1.55, 95\% CI 1.09-2.21). CONCLUSION: Post-operative weight loss and low BMI at 6 months post-surgery are independent markers of poor prognosis in patients who undergo surgery for oesophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) measured by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) in patients with esophageal carcinoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 151 patients with pathologically proven esophageal carcinoma (146 squamous cell carcinomas and 5 adenocarcinomas) who underwent pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET. MTV and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for the primary tumors were measured by (18)F-FDG PET. The prognostic significance of MTV, SUVmax, and other clinicopathological variables was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. To further evaluate and compare the predictive performance of PET parameters, MTV and SUVmax, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used. RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, age, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) factors, MTV, and SUVmax of primary tumor were significant predictors of survival. On multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and treatment modality, independent predictive factors associated with decreased overall survival were T stage [hazard ratio (HR) 4.325, P = 0.006], M stage (HR 2.009, P = 0.007), and MTV (HR 1.013, P = 0.021). SUVmax was not a significant factor (HR 0.97, P = 0.061). On time-dependent ROC analysis, MTV showed good predictive performance for overall survival consistently better than SUVmax. CONCLUSION: MTV, a volumetric parameter of (18)F-FDG PET, is an important independent prognostic factor for survival and a better predictor of survival than SUVmax for the primary tumor in patients with esophageal carcinoma.},

Reduced pulmonary functions and exercise capacity are known as risk factors for complications after esophagectomy. The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a simple field test that can be used to evaluate the functional exercise capacity of patients who undergo thoracic surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the preoperative 6MWD with postoperative complications in patients with esophageal cancer. Records of a total of 111 patients who underwent thoracic surgery followed by postoperative rehabilitation from January 2013 to December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Data of patients who experienced Clavien-Dindo grade II or severer (grade~{$\geq~$}II) complications were compared with those who experienced grade~{$\leq$}I complications. The 6MWD was significantly correlated with age, serum albumin concentration, hemoglobin concentration, and hand grip strength. A total of 42 patients experienced grade~{$\geq$}II. The 6MWD of patients with grade~{$\geq~$}II complications was significantly shorter than that of those with grade~{$\leq$}I complications. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, 6MWD~{$\leq~$}454 m was a threshold for predicting grade~{$\geq$}II complications with 71.0\% sensitivity and 54.8\% specificity. The incidence of grade~{$\geq$}II complications led to delayed ambulation and longer stays in hospital. In the multiple regression analysis, the preoperative risk factors for incidence of grade~{$\geq$}II complications included lower levels of preoperative 6MWD and \% of the predicted value of forced expiratory volume in 1~second. Our results indicate that the 6MWT is useful to assess preoperative physical status in patients with esophageal cancer.},

This study is a single institution retrospective analysis of outcome after esophagectomy for cancer of the esophagus and GEJ in patients aged over 75 years. METHODS: All consecutive patients 76 years old and over undergoing curative esophagectomy for cancer in the period 1991-2006 were analyzed as to comorbidities, outcome and long-term survival. All the data had been prospectively collected in a database. Postoperative mortality risk was assessed by P-POSSUM and O-POSSUM score for in-hospital mortality and by the recently published Steyerberg's score system [Steyerberg EW, Neville BA, Koppert LB, Lemmens VEPP, Tilanus HW, Coebergh JWW, Weeks JC, Earle CC. Surgical mortality in patients with esophageal cancer: development and validation of a simple risk score. J Clin Oncol 2006;24:4277-84.] for 30-day mortality. Five-year survival was compared to the standardized survival in the general population. RESULTS: One hundred and eight patients fulfilling the abovementioned criteria were found (76 males and 32 females, mean age 79.5 years, mean standardized life-expectancy: 7.36 years). Among them, 69\% had esophageal tumors and 31\% GEJ tumors. The predominant histology was adenocarcinoma (74\%). Eighty-six (79.6\%) presented with one or more major comorbidities or a history of previous major upper-GI surgery, potentially affecting the surgical outcome. All underwent resection with curative intent (R(0) 83.3\%, R(1) 12\%, R(2) 4.6\%). The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 51.9\%, pulmonary complications (37\%) being the most frequent. Postoperative mortality, mainly due to cardiopulmonary complications, was 7.4\%, which was consistent with that predicted by P-POSSUM score (7.2\%) and lower than that predicted by O-POSSUM score (15.1\%). Thirty-day mortality was 5.5\%, being consistent with that predicted by the Steyerberg's score (6.8\%). Overall 5-year survival was 35.7\%, while R(0) overall survival 42\% and cancer specific R(0) survival 51.7\%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients 76 years old and over with esophageal or GEJ cancer should not be denied surgery solely on the basis of age. Outcome and long-term results in the selected elderly are not differing from those reported for younger patients. However, despite thorough preoperative assessment being applied in the selection of the candidates for surgery, a practical and reliable individual risk-analysis stratification is still lacking.},

  abstract = {AIM: To develop a fully automated deep-learning-based approach to measure muscle area for assessing sarcopenia on standard-of-care computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen without any case exclusion criteria, for opportunistic screening for frailty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This ethically approved retrospective study used publicly available and institutional unselected abdominal CT images (n=1,070 training, n=31 testing). The method consisted of two sequential steps: section detection from CT volume followed by muscle segmentation on single-section. Both stages used fully convolutional neural networks (FCNN), based on a UNet-like architecture. Input data consisted of CT volumes with a variety of fields of view, section thicknesses, occlusions, artefacts, and anatomical variations. Output consisted of segmented muscle area on a CT section at the L3 vertebral level. The muscle was segmented into erector spinae, psoas, and rectus abdominus muscle groups. Output was tested against expert manual segmentation. RESULTS: Threefold cross-validation was used to evaluate the model. Section detection cross-validation error was 1.41~{$\pm~$}5.02 (in sections). Segmentation cross-validation Dice overlaps were 0.97~{$\pm~$}0.02, 0.95~{$\pm~$}0.04, and 0.94~{$\pm~$}0.04 for erector spinae, psoas, and rectus abdominus, respectively, and 0.96~{$\pm~$}0.02 for the combined muscle area, with R2~=~0.95/0.98 for muscle attenuation/area in 28/31 hold-out test cases. No statistical difference was found between the automated output and a second annotator. Fully automated processing took {$<$}1 second per CT examination. CONCLUSIONS: A FCNN pipeline accurately and efficiently automates muscle segmentation at the L3 vertebral level from unselected abdominal CT volumes, with no manual processing step. This approach is promising as a generalisable tool for opportunistic screening for frailty on standard-of-care CT.},

  abstract = {Background Abdominal and thoracic CT provide a valuable opportunity for osteoporosis screening regardless of the clinical indication for imaging. Purpose To establish reference normative ranges for first lumbar vertebra (L1) trabecular attenuation values across all adult ages to measure bone mineral density (BMD) at routine CT. Materials and Methods Reference data were constructed from 20 374 abdominal and/or thoracic CT examinations performed at 120 kV. Data were derived from adults (mean age, 60 years {$\pm$} 12 [standard deviation]; 56.1\% [11 428 of 20 374] women). CT examinations were performed with (n = 4263) or without (n = 16 111) intravenous contrast agent administration for a variety of unrelated clinical indications between 2000 and 2018. L1 Hounsfield unit measurement was obtained either with a customized automated tool (n = 11 270) or manually by individual readers (n = 9104). The effects of patient age, sex, contrast agent, and manual region-of-interest versus fully automated L1 Hounsfield unit measurement were assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results Mean L1 attenuation decreased linearly with age at a rate of 2.5 HU per year, averaging 226 HU {$\pm$} 44 for patients younger than 30 years and 89 HU {$\pm$} 38 for patients 90 years or older. Women had a higher mean L1 attenuation compared with men (P {$<$} .008) until menopause, after which both groups had similar values. Administration of intravenous contrast agent resulted in negligible differences in mean L1 attenuation values except in patients younger than 40 years. The fully automated method resulted in measurements that were average 21 HU higher compared with manual measurement (P {$<$} .004); at intrapatient subanalysis, this difference was related to the level of transverse measurement used (midvertebra vs off-midline level). Conclusion Normative ranges of L1 vertebra trabecular attenuation were established across all adult ages, and these can serve as a quick reference at routine CT to identify adults with low bone mineral density who are at risk for osteoporosis. \textcopyright{} RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

  abstract = {Background We aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of sarcopenia by the original and revised European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP 1 and 2), and to propose a new sarcopenia phenotype score (SPS) to improve relevance of clinical outcomes. Methods Analyses were performed in 1408 older adults of the Aging Study of PyeongChang Rural Area, a community-based cohort in Korea. For sarcopenia definitions, we used EWGSOP 1, EWGSOP 2, and SPS, a new index counting number of abnormal domains among components of grip strength, gait speed, or muscle mass. Frailty status by the frailty index and the Cardiovascular Health Study frailty score was compared with sarcopenia measures. Prediction ability for composite outcome combining death and institutionalization due to functional decline was assessed among sarcopenia measures. Results Generally, sarcopenia spectrum by both EWGSOP 1 and 2 was associated with worse functional status in parameters of geriatric assessments. However, population who were considered as sarcopenic by EWGSOP 1, but not by EWGSOP 2, showed increased risk of composite outcome and worse frailty status, compared with people who were classified as not sarcopenic by both EWGSOP 1 and 2. With SPS, dose\textendash response relationship was observed with both frailty status and outcome prediction. Prediction for composite outcome was better in SPS than in EWGSOP 2 classification. Conclusions A new SPS might be used to classify sarcopenic burden in older adults to resolve possible inconsistencies in phenotype correlation and outcome prediction of EWGSOP 2 criteria.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nutritional deficits, cachexia, and sarcopenia are extremely common in esophageal cancer. The aim of this article was to assess the effect of loss of skeletal muscle mass during neoadjuvant treatment on the prognosis of esophageal cancer patients. METHODS: Esophageal cancer patients (N~=\,115) undergoing neoadjuvant therapy and surgery between 2010 and 2014 were identified from our surgery database and retrospectively analyzed. Computed tomography imaging of the total cross-sectional muscle tissue measured at the third lumbar level defined the skeletal muscle index, which defined sarcopenia (SMI\,{$<$}\,52.4~cm2/m2 for men and {$<$}\,38.5~cm2/m2 for women). Images were collected before and after neoadjuvant treatments. RESULTS: Sarcopenia in preoperative imaging was prevalent in 92 patients (80\%). Median overall survival was 900~days (interquartile range 334-1447) with no difference between sarcopenic (median\,=\,900) and non-sarcopenic (median\,=\,914) groups (p~=\,0.872). Complication rates did not differ (26.1\% vs 32.6\%, p~=\,0.725). A 2.98\% decrease in skeletal muscle index during neoadjuvant treatment correlated with poor 2-year survival (log-rank p~=\,0.04). CONCLUSION: Loss of skeletal muscle tissue during neoadjuvant treatment correlates with worse overall survival.},

Patients with more comorbidities or advanced age are more likely to be given definitive chemoradiation due to surgical risk. We aimed to identify subsets of patients in whom the addition of surgery to chemoradiation does not provide an overall survival (OS) benefit. The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received either definitive chemoradiation or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Bivariate analysis was used to assess the association between patient characteristics and treatment groups. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were performed to assess for differences in survival. A total of 15,090 with adenocarcinoma and 5,356 with squamous cell carcinoma met the inclusion criteria. Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery had significantly improved survival by Cox proportional hazards model regardless of histology if {$<$}50, 50-60, 61-70, or 71-80~years old. There was no significant benefit or detriment in patients 81-90~years old.

The results of these studies support the concept that, just as in many other solid malignancies, systemic spread may happen at an early stage in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer. Such systemic spread is often occult (micrometastases) at the time of primary diagnosis, which may have adverse effects on survival. Improved staging can be expected with information on micrometastases, and a subgroup of patients who will benefit most from adjuvant therapy might be identified. Although reliable and standard methods need to be developed before detection of micrometastasis is incorporated in the routine clinical practice, we suggest that it be considered an important correlate in clinical trials in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To ascertain if preoperative short-term radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy is not inferior to a standard schedule of long-term chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with distal or middle-third, clinical primary tumor stage 3-4 and/or regional lymph node-positive rectal cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) to short-term radiotherapy (25 Gy in five fractions over 1 week) followed by four cycles of chemotherapy (total neoadjuvant therapy [TNT]) or chemoradiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, concurrently with capecitabine [chemoradiotherapy; CRT]). Total mesorectal excision was undertaken 6-8 weeks after preoperative treatment, with two additional cycles of CAPOX (intravenous oxaliplatin [130 mg/m2, once a day] on day 1 and capecitabine [1,000 mg/m2, twice a day] from days 1 to 14) in the TNT group and six cycles of CAPOX in the CRT group. The primary end point was 3-year disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Between August 2015 and August 2018, a total of 599 patients were randomly assigned to receive TNT (n = 302) or CRT (n = 297). At a median follow-up of 35.0 months, 3-year DFS was 64.5\% and 62.3\% in TNT and CRT groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.883; one-sided 95\% CI, not applicable to 1.11; P {$<$} .001 for noninferiority). There was no significant difference in metastasis-free survival or locoregional recurrence, but the TNT group had better 3-year overall survival than the CRT group (86.5\% v 75.1\%; P = .033). Treatment effects on DFS and overall survival were similar regardless of prognostic factors. The prevalence of acute grade III-V toxicities during preoperative treatment was 26.5\% in the TNT group versus 12.6\% in the CRT group (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: Short-term radiotherapy with preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery was efficacious with acceptable toxicity and could be used as an alternative to CRT for locally advanced rectal cancer.},

We previously published a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 16-week trial on effects of once-daily glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, liraglutide on weight, satiation, and gastric functions in obese volunteers. The aim of this substudy is to compare to placebo the effects of liraglutide on appetite, taste preference, regional body fat stores, and anthropometric measurements. METHODS: Forty obese adults received standard instruction for weight management, monthly behavioral intervention utilizing motivational interviews, and 16-week treatment of once-daily liraglutide (escalated to 3 mg SQ daily). At baseline and 16 weeks, the following were measured: appetite and taste preferences rated every 30 min for 5 h after ingesting 300 mL Ensure\textregistered; maximal tolerated volume (MTV) with a nutrient drink test; fasting and postprandial bioactive GLP-1 (7-36) and peptide YY (PYY) levels; total and regional body fat with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and waist and hip circumference. RESULTS: Thirty-five participants (17 liraglutide; 18 placebo) completed the trial. Compared to placebo group, liraglutide group had significant reductions in MTV; prospective food consumption score; desire to eat something sweet, salty, savory or fatty; and an increase in perceived fullness. Postprandial plasma levels of GLP-1 decreased and PYY levels increased with liraglutide relative to baseline. Significant reductions in total body, trunk, and upper and lower body fat without reduction in lean body mass were observed. CONCLUSION: Liraglutide 3 mg SQ modulates appetite, taste preference, gut hormones, and regional body fat stores in adults with obesity without reduction in lean body mass.},

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: MIE provides lower postoperative morbidity and mortality, and similar short-term oncological quality compared to OE. METHODS: Data was acquired from the Dutch Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Audit. Patients undergoing minimally invasive or open, transthoracic or transhiatal esophagectomy for primary esophageal cancer between 2011-2015 were included. A propensity-score matching analysis for MIE versus OE was performed separately for transthoracic and transhiatal esophagectomies. RESULTS: A total of 1036 transthoracic MIE and OE patients, and 582 transhiatal MIE and OE patients were matched. Long-term survival was comparable for MIE and OE for both transthoracic and transhiatal procedures (5-year overall survival: transthoracic MIE 49.2\% vs. OE 51.1\%, p 0.695; transhiatal MIE 48.4\% vs. OE 50.7\%, p 0.832). For both procedures, MIE yielded more lymph nodes (transthoracic median 21 vs. 18, p {$<$} 0.001; transhiatal 15 vs. 13, p 0.007). Post-operative morbidity was comparable after transthoracic MIE and OE (60.8\% vs. 64.9\%, p 0.177), with a reduced length of stay after transthoracic MIE (median 12 vs. 15 days, p {$<$} 0.001). After transhiatal MIE, more postoperative complications (64.9\% vs. 56.4\%, p 0.034) were observed, without subsequent difference in length of stay. CONCLUSION: Long-term survival after minimally invasive esophagectomy was equivalent to open in both propensity-score matched cohorts of patients undergoing transthoracic or transhiatal esophageal resections. Transhiatal minimally invasive esophagectomy was accompanied with more post-operative morbidity. Both transthoracic and transhiatal minimally invasive esophagectomy resulted in a more extended lymphadenectomy.},

The trial was conducted with the use of standardization and quality-control measures to ensure the consistency of the radiotherapy, surgery, and pathological techniques. RESULTS: Of the 1861 patients randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups, 1805 were eligible to participate. The overall rate of survival at two years among the eligible patients was 82.0 percent in the group assigned to both radiotherapy and surgery and 81.8 percent in the group assigned to surgery alone (P=0.84). Among the 1748 patients who underwent a macroscopically complete local resection, the rate of local recurrence at two years was 5.3 percent. The rate of local recurrence at two years was 2.4 percent in the radiotherapy-plus-surgery group and 8.2 percent in the surgery-only group (P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence in patients with rectal cancer who undergo a standardized total mesorectal excision.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role and potential value of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in certain tumors has been widely investigated in recent years. The authors retrospectively assessed the performance of 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in the assessment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: The results using PET were compared with those using computed tomography (CT), and these were correlated with the pathologic findings. The authors studied 32 patients with thoracic esophageal SCC who had undergone radical esophagectomy. RESULTS: Uptake of FDG in the primary tumor was found in 25 of the 32 (78.1\%) cases. Comparison of the FDG uptake and the clinicopathologic findings showed that there was a significant association between the FDG uptake and each of the depth of tumor invasion (P {$<$} 0.05), occurrence of lymph node metastasis (P {$<$} 0.01), and lymphatic invasion (P {$<$} 0.01). The survival rate in cases with high FDG uptake (standardized uptake value [SUV], {$>$}3) was significantly lower than that in cases with low FDG uptake (SUV, {$<$} 3; P {$<$} 0.05). In the evaluation of lymph node staging by the detection of lymph node metastasis, FDG-PET showed 77.8\% sensitivity, 92.9\% specificity, and 84.4\% accuracy, and CT scanning showed 61.1\% sensitivity, 71.4\% specificity, and 65.6\% accuracy. Positron emission tomography scanning showed a high degree of accuracy in the neck, upper thoracic, and abdominal regions. However, in the mid- and lower thoracic regions, the sensitivity was very low. The smallest lymph node metastasis that was detected by FDG-PET imaging was 6 mm. The average size of lymph node metastasis that was undetected by FDG-PET scanning was 7.3 mm (range, 1-17 mm). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, FDG-PET may be used as a noninvasive diagnostic technique in assessing the aggressiveness of the tumor and the prognosis in patients with esophageal SCC. During the preoperative diagnostic procedures, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of lymph node staging is higher with FDG-PET than with CT imaging. In view of the high specificity of FDG-PET, it also gives useful information to guide the choice of treatment of esophageal carcinoma.},

  abstract = {Esophageal cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Complete resection of esophageal cancer and adjacent malignant lymph nodes is the only potentially curative treatment. Accurate preoperative staging and assessment of therapeutic response after neoadjuvant therapy are crucial in determining the most suitable therapy and avoiding inappropriate attempts at curative surgery. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for initial imaging following confirmation of malignancy at pathologic analysis, primarily to rule out unresectable or distant metastatic disease. With the advent of multidetector CT, use of thin sections and multiplanar reformation allows more accurate staging of esophageal cancer. Endoscopic ultrasonography (US) is the best modality for determining the depth of tumor invasion and presence of regional lymph node involvement. Combined use of fine-needle aspiration and endoscopic US can improve assessment of lymph node involvement. Positron emission tomography (PET) is useful for assessment of distant metastases but is not appropriate for detecting and staging primary tumors. PET may also be helpful in restaging after neoadjuvant therapy, since it allows identification of early response to treatment and detection of interval distant metastases. Each imaging modality has its advantages and disadvantages; therefore, CT, endoscopic US, and PET should be considered complementary modalities for preoperative staging and therapeutic monitoring of patients with esophageal cancer.},

Methods: This retrospective study consisted of a total of 149 consecutive SCLC patients. The cross-sectional area of muscle at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) was measured using baseline CT images. Sarcopenia was defined as a L3 muscle index of less than 55\,cm2/m2 for men and of less than 39\,cm2/m2 for women as proposed by international consensus of cancer cachexia. In addition, Korean-specific cutoffs for sarcopenia was also applied (49\,cm2/m2 for men and 31\,cm2/m2 for women). Overall survival (OS) and clinical characteristics of patients with or without sarcopenia were compared. Results: Mean patient age was 68.6\,{$\pm$}\,9.5 years. Most were male (85.3\%) and 67.8\% had extensive disease at time of diagnosis. Sarcopenia was present in 118 patients (79.2\%) and was significantly related to an advanced age (p = 0.028), male sex (p {$<$} 0.001), lower body mass index (p {$<$} 0.001), and poor performance status (p = 0.049). Sarcopenic patients had shorter OS than nonsarcopenic patients (median: 8.6 months versus 16.8 months; p = 0.031). Multivariable analysis revealed that sarcopenia was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival (hazards ratio: 1.68; 95\% confidence interval: 1.04\textendash 2.72; p = 0.034), along with extensive stage (p {$<$} 0.001), supportive care only (p {$<$} 0.001), and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (p = 0.020). Using Korean sarcopenia cutoffs, sarcopenic patients were also found to have poorer OS than nonsarcopenic patients, however, the survival difference was not statistically significant (median: 8.4 months versus 12.7 months; p = 0.144 by the log-rank test). Conclusions: Sarcopenia as determined by CT could be used to predict prognosis in patients with SCLC. Optimum reference values},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 136 patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Preoperative characteristics, surgical methods, postoperative outcomes and weight changes at 6 months after surgery were analyzed. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients had more than 10\% WL compared to their weight at surgery. On univariate analysis, higher body mass index [(BMI): {$\geq$}20.8; p=0.012] and shorter length of hospitalization [(LOH); p=0.041] demonstrated an association with more than 10\% WL. On multivariate analysis, higher BMI [odds ratio (OR)=2.821; 95\% confidence interval (CI)=1.238-6.426; p=0.014] and shorter LOH (OR=2.953; 95\% CI=1.009-8.646; p=0.048) were independently associated with more than 10\% WL.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Esophageal obstruction due to cancer can produce debilitating dysphagia. Rapid palliation is usually possible with endoscopic placement of a plastic esophageal prosthesis, but this device has a high rate of complications. A new alternative is a metal-mesh stent that collapses to 3 mm in diameter at placement but can then expand up to 16 mm. METHODS: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (39 patients) or malignant extrinsic obstruction (3 patients) were randomly assigned to treatment with either a plastic prosthesis (16 mm in diameter) or an expansile metal-mesh stent. The patients were evaluated every six weeks until death. The degree of palliation was expressed as a dysphagia score and a Karnofsky performance score. RESULTS: Complications were significantly less frequent with the metal stents than with the plastic prostheses (no complications vs. nine; P {$<$} 0.001). The dysphagia and Karnofsky scores improved significantly and to a similar degree in both treatment groups. The most common causes of recurrent dysphagia were migration of the plastic prostheses (five patients) and ingrowth or overgrowth of the metal stents by tumor (five patients). The rates of reintervention were similar in both treatment groups, as were the 30-day mortality rates. The period of hospitalization after placement of a prosthesis was significantly longer in the group given plastic prostheses than in the group given metal stents (mean +/- SE, 12.5 +/- 2.1 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.0 days; P = 0.005). Despite their higher initial cost, the metal stents were cost effective because of the absence of fatal complications and the decrease in the hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Expansile metal stents are a safe and cost-effective alternative to conventional plastic endoprostheses in the treatment of esophageal obstruction due to inoperable cancer.},

In the pivotal Intergroup-0116 Phase III trial by Macdonald et all, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy improved both disease-free and overall survival in curatively resected patients with mainly gastric adenocarcinoma. We compared survival data for curatively resected patients with adeno-carcinoma solely at the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ), treated with surgery alone or surgery and adjuvant chemoradio-therapy. METHODS: From 2003 to 2009, 211 patients underwent curative resection. Surgery alone was performed in 95 pa-tients and 116 patients received adjuvant therapy after resection. All patients underwent Lewis-Tanner operation with D1 node resection including coliac nodes (D1+). Informations about recurrence and death were collected from the Danish Cancer Register and the Central Death Register. Patients who died after experiencing severe complications after surgery were excluded from the survival analysis. Patients with T0N0 or T1N0 were also excluded because patients of this category were not given adjuvant therapy according to the Macdonald protocol. RESULTS: Patients with positive node status in the resected specimen, the 3-year disease-free survival after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (n = 91) or surgery alone (n = 43) was 24\% and 37\%, respectively. Median time of survival was prolonged by 10 month in favour of those who received chemoradiotherapy. However, after controlling for the confounding effect of age and node status, only positive node status in the resected specimen had significant partial effect on survival. CONCLUSION: Chemoradiotherapy according to the Intergroup-0116 protocol might still be a reasonable option after curative resection in patients with GEJ adenocarcinomas and positive lymph node status, who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.},

This study aimed to assess the effect of severe weight loss postoperatively and enteral nutrition via an FT on long-term prognosis after oesophagectomy. METHODS: This study analysed 317 patients who underwent minimally invasive oesophagectomy at Kobe University Hospital and Hyogo Cancer Center from 2010 to 2015. The patients' body weight was evaluated at 3~months postoperatively. They were organised into the severe weight loss (n\,=\,65) and moderate weight loss (n\,=\,252) groups. Furthermore, they were categorised into the FT group (184 patients who had an FT placed during oesophagectomy) and no-FT group (133 patients without FT). Patients (119 per group) matched for the FT and no-FT groups were identified via propensity score matching. RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate in the severe weight loss group was significantly lower (p\,=\,0.024). In the multivariate analysis, tumour invasion depth (pT3-4), preoperative therapy and severe weight loss had a worse OS (hazard ratio\,=\,1.89; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.12-3.17, hazard ratio\,=\,2.11; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.25-3.54, hazard ratio\,=\,1.82; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.02-3.524, respectively). No significant differences in the number of severe weight loss patients and OS were found between the FT and no-FT groups. CONCLUSION: Severe weight loss is significantly associated with poor OS. In addition, enteral nutrition via an FT did not improve the severe weight loss and OS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) is related to higher mortality in several cancers, but the association with colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis is unclear. METHODS: This observational study included 3262 men and women from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population diagnosed between 2006 and 2011 with AJCC stages I to III CRC. The authors evaluated hazard ratios (HRs) of low SMD for all-cause and CRC-specific mortality, assessed by computed tomography using optimal stratification, compared with patients with normal SMD. They also evaluated the cross-classification of categories of low versus normal SMD and muscle mass (MM) with outcomes. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 6.9 years. Optimal stratification cutpoints for SMD were 32.5 in women and 35.5 in men. In multivariate-adjusted analyses, among patients with CRC, those with low SMD demonstrated higher overall (HR, 1.61; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 1.36-1.90) and CRC-specific (HR, 1.74; 95\% CI, 1.38-2.21) mortality when compared with those with normal SMD levels. Patients with low SMD and low MM (ie, sarcopenia) were found to have the highest overall (HR, 2.02; 95\% CI, 1.65-2.47) and CRC-specific (HR, 2.54; 95\% CI, 1.91-3.37) mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CRC, those with low SMD were found to have elevated risks of disease-specific and overall mortality, independent of MM or adiposity.

METHODS: In total, 336 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent surgery between January 2011 and April 2017 were included in this study. We investigated the relationship between the CCI and postoperative nutrition indexes. RESULTS: Patients were divided into two groups: CCI {$\leq$}1 (low CCI group) and CCI {$\geq$}2 (high CCI group). A high CCI was significantly associated with shortened overall survival (OS; 3-year OS rate of 77.9\% in the low CCI group versus 59.7\% in the high CCI group; p~=~0.008). Nutritional indexes, such as the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), at 1~month after esophagectomy were significantly lower in the high CCI group than in the low CCI group (p~=~0.031); however, the PNI at 6 months after surgery was similar between the high and low CCI groups. Multivariate analysis identified high CCI as an independent risk factor associated with PNI {$<$}45 in esophageal cancer patients at 1 month after esophagectomy (p~=~0.047). CONCLUSION: This study showed that CCI {$\geq$}2 was significantly associated with poor PNI at 1 month after surgery for esophageal cancer, indicating that it is necessary to administer effective nutritional interventions for patients with postoperative malnutrition, especially those with multiple comorbidities.},

The purpose of this work was to develop and validate automated and manual image processing techniques for detailed and efficient analysis of body composition from CT data. The study comprised 107 subjects examined in the Swedish CArdioPulmonary BioImage Study (SCAPIS) using a 3-slice CT protocol covering liver, abdomen, and thighs. Algorithms were developed for automated assessment of liver attenuation, visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) abdominal adipose tissue, thigh muscles, subcutaneous, subfascial (SFAT) and intermuscular adipose tissue. These were validated using manual reference measurements. SFAT was studied in selected subjects were the fascia lata could be visually identified (approx. 5\%). In addition, precision of manual measurements of intra- (IPAT) and retroperitoneal adipose tissue (RPAT) and deep- and superficial SAT was evaluated using repeated measurements. Automated measurements correlated strongly to manual reference measurements. The SFAT depot showed the weakest correlation (r\,=\,0.744). Automated VAT and SAT measurements were slightly, but significantly overestimated ({$\leq$}4.6\%, p\,{$\leq$}\,0.001). Manual segmentation of abdominal sub-depots showed high repeatability (CV\,{$\leq$}\,8.1\%, r\,{$\geq$}\,0.930). We conclude that the low dose CT-scanning and automated analysis makes the setup suitable for large-scale studies.},

Women with stage IIIC/IV EOC who underwent PDS with curative intent between 1/1/2006 and 12/ 31/2012 were included. Patient variables and vital status were abstracted. Body composition was evaluated in a semi-automated process using Slice-O-Matic software v4.3 (TomoVision). Skeletal muscle area and mean skeletal muscle attenuation were recorded. Associations with overall survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models and recursive partitioning. Results. We identified 296 patients and 132 (44.6\%) were classified as sarcopenic. The average mean skeletal muscle attenuation of the entire cohort was 33.4 Hounsfield units (HU). A multivariate model of overall risk of death included histology, residual disease, and mean skeletal attenuation. Among patients without residual disease, overall survival, but not progression free survival was significantly different between patients with low versus high mean skeletal attenuation (median survival, 2.8 vs. 3.3 years). Among patients with residual disease, overall survival was significantly different between patients with low versus high mean skeletal attenuation {$\geq$}36.40 vs. b36.40 HU (median survival, 2.0 vs. 3.3 years). Conclusions. Sarcopenia and low mean skeletal muscle attenuation are common in women undergoing PDS for advanced EOC. These factors are associated with poorer outcomes, and can be used in preoperative risk stratification and patient counseling. Further research into body composition and whether this risk factor can be altered via nutrition or fitness in this population is warranted.},

The prognostic impact of SMI changes during consecutive palliative systemic treatments is unknown. METHODS: This is a~retrospective analysis~of the phase 3 CAIRO3 study. The CAIRO3 study randomized 557 patients between maintenance capecitabine~+~bevacizumab (CAP-B) or observation, after six cycles capecitabine~+~oxaliplatin~+~bevacizumab (CAPOX-B). Upon first disease progression (PD1), CAPOX-B was reintroduced until second progression (PD2). SMI was assessed by computed tomography (CT) (total 1355 scans). SMI and body mass index (BMI) changes were analyzed for three time-periods; p1: during initial CAPOX-B, p2: randomization to PD1, and p3: PD1 to PD2. The association between absolute and change in SMI and BMI (both per 1 standard deviation) during p1-p3, with PD1, PD2, and survival was studied by Cox regression models. RESULTS: This analysis included 450 of the 557 patients randomized in the CAIRO3 study. Mean SMI decreased during p1: mean -0.6 SMI units [95\% CI -1.07;-0.26] and p3: -2.2 units [-2.7;-1.8], whereas during p2, SMI increased~+~1.2 units [0.8-1.6]. BMI changes did not reflect changes in SMI. SMI loss during p2 and p3 was significantly associated with shorter survival (HR 1.19 [1.09-1.35]; 1.54 [1.31-1.79], respectively). Sarcopenia at PD1 was significantly associated with early PD2 (HR 1.40 [1.10-1.70]). BMI loss independent of SMI loss was only associated with shorter overall survival during p3 (HR 1.35 [1.14-1.63]). CONCLUSIONS: In mCRC patients, SMI loss during palliative systemic treatment was related with early disease progression and reduced survival. BMI did not reflect changes in SMI and could not identify patients at risk of poor outcome during early treatment lines.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that severe skeletal muscle index (SMI) loss (sarcopenia) is associated with poor overall survival in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, but its mechanisms are unknown. We recently found, using data of the randomized phase 3 CAIRO3 study, that SMI loss was related with shorter time to disease progression and overall survival during first-line maintenance treatment with capecitabine~+~bevacizumab (CAP-B) or observation and during more intensive capecitabine~+~oxaliplatin~+~bevacizumab (CAPOX-B) reintroduction treatment. As a potential risk factor for reduced survival, we explored whether sarcopenia and SMI loss were associated with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during CAP-B and CAPOX-B. METHODS: Sarcopenia status and SMI loss were assessed by using consecutive computed tomography scans. DLTs were defined as any dose delay/reduction/discontinuation of systemic treatment because of reported CTCAE (version 3.0) toxicities at the start or during treatment. Poisson regression models were used to study whether sarcopenia and body mass index (BMI) at the start of treatment and SMI and BMI loss during treatment were associated with DLTs. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-two patients (mean age 63.0~{$\pm~$}8.8~years, 37\% female) received CAP-B, and 232 patients (mean age 63.0~{$\pm~$}9.0~years, 34\% female) received CAPOX-B. At the start of CAP-B and CAPOX-B, 54\% and 46\% of patients were sarcopenic, respectively. Mean BMI was lower in sarcopenic patients, although patients were on average still overweight (sarcopenic vs. non-sarcopenic at the start of CAP-B 25.0~{$\pm~$}3.9 vs. 26.7~{$\pm~$}4.1 and CAPOX-B 25.8~{$\pm~$}3.8 vs. 27.1~{$\pm~$}3.8~kg/m2 ). Sarcopenia at the start of CAP-B was not associated with DLTs [relative risk 0.87 (95\% confidence interval 0.64-1.19)], whereas patients with {$>$}2\% SMI loss had a significantly higher risk of DLTs [1.29 (1.01-1.66)]. At the start of subsequent CAPOX-B, 25\% of patients received a dose reduction, and the risk of dose reduction was significantly higher for patients with preceding SMI loss [1.78 (1.06-3.01)] or sarcopenia [1.75 (1.08-2.86)]. After the received dose reductions, sarcopenia or SMI loss was not significantly associated with a higher risk of DLTs during CAPOX-B [sarcopenia vs. non-sarcopenic: 0.86 (0.69-1.08) and SMI loss vs. stable/gain: 0.83 (0.65-1.07)]. In contrast, BMI (loss) at the start or during either treatment was not associated with an increased risk of DLTs. CONCLUSIONS: In this large longitudinal study in metastatic colorectal cancer patients during palliative systemic treatment, sarcopenia and/or muscle loss was associated with an increased risk of DLTs. BMI was not associated with DLTs and could not detect sarcopenia or SMI loss. Prospective (randomized) studies should reveal whether normalizing chemotherapeutic doses to muscle mass or muscle mass preservation (by exercise and nutritional interventions) increases chemotherapeutic tolerance and improves survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Observational studies suggest that loss of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) is associated with chemotherapy-related toxicity, poor quality of life, and poor survival in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. Little is known about the evolution of SMM during palliative systemic therapy. We investigated changes in SMM during various consecutive palliative systemic treatment regimens using repeated abdominal computed tomography scans of mCRC patients who participated in the randomized phase 3 CAIRO3 study. METHODS: In the CAIRO3 study, mCRC patients with stable disease or better after 6~cycles of first-line treatment with capecitabine~+~oxaliplatin~+~bevacizumab (CAPOX-B) were randomized between maintenance treatment with capecitabine~+~bevacizumab (CAP-B) or observation. Upon first disease progression, in both groups, CAPOX-B or other treatment was reintroduced until the second disease progression, which was the primary study endpoint. We analysed 1355 computed tomography scans of 450 (81\%) CAIRO3 patients (64~{$\pm~$}9.0~years, CAP-B n~=~223; observation n~=~227) for SMM at four time points (i.e. prior to the start of pre-randomization initial treatment, at randomization, and at first and at second disease progression) using the Slice-o-matic software and single slice evaluation at the lumbar 3 level. By using accepted and widely used formulas, whole body SMM was calculated. A linear mixed effects model, adjusted for relevant confounders, was used to assess SMM changes for the total group and within and between study arms. RESULTS: During 6~cycles of initial treatment with CAPOX-B prior to randomization, SMM decreased significantly in all patients [CAP-B arm: -0.53~kg (95\% CI -1.12; -0.07) and observation arm: -0.85~kg (-1.45; -0.25)]. After randomization, SMM recovered during CAP-B treatment by 1.32~kg (0.73; 1.90) and observation by 1.20~kg (0.63; 1.78) (median time from randomization to first disease progression 8.6 and 4.1~months for CAP-B arm and observation arm, respectively). After first progression and during reintroduction treatment with CAPOX-B or other treatment, SMM again decreased significantly and comparable in both arms, CAP-B: -2.71~kg (-3.37; -2.03), and observation: -2.01~kg (-2.64; -1.41) (median time from first progression until second progression CAP-B arm: 4.7~months and observation arm: 6.6~months). CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study provides a unique insight in SMM changes in mCRC patients during palliative systemic treatment regimens, including observation. Our data show that muscle loss is reversible and may be influenced by the intensity of systemic regimens. Although studies have shown prognostic capacity for SMM, the effects of subsequent changes in SMM are unknown and may be clues for new future therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The ARTIST (Adjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy in Stomach Cancer) trial was the first study to our knowledge to investigate the role of postoperative chemoradiotherapy therapy in patients with curatively resected gastric cancer with D2 lymph node dissection. This trial was designed to compare postoperative treatment with capecitabine plus cisplatin (XP) versus XP plus radiotherapy with capecitabine (XP/XRT/XP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The XP arm received six cycles of XP (capecitabine 2,000 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 14 and cisplatin 60 mg/m2 on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks) chemotherapy. The XP/XRT/XP arm received two cycles of XP followed by 45-Gy XRT (capecitabine 1,650 mg/m2 per day for 5 weeks) and two cycles of XP. RESULTS: Of 458 patients, 228 were randomly assigned to the XP arm and 230 to the XP/XRT/XP arm. Treatment was completed as planned by 75.4\% of patients (172 of 228) in the XP arm and 81.7\% (188 of 230) in the XP/XRT/XP arm. Overall, the addition of XRT to XP chemotherapy did not significantly prolong disease-free survival (DFS; P = .0862). However, in the subgroup of patients with pathologic lymph node metastasis at the time of surgery (n = 396), patients randomly assigned to the XP/XRT/XP arm experienced superior DFS when compared with those who received XP alone (P = .0365), and the statistical significance was retained at multivariate analysis (estimated hazard ratio, 0.6865; 95\% CI, 0.4735 to 0.9952; P = .0471). CONCLUSION The addition of XRT to XP chemotherapy did not significantly reduce recurrence after curative resection and D2 lymph node dissection in gastric cancer. A subsequent trial (ARTIST-II) in patients with lymph node-positive gastric cancer is planned.},

  abstract = {Pretreatment risk stratification is key for personalized medicine. While many physicians rely on an "eyeball test" to assess whether patients will tolerate major surgery or chemotherapy, "eyeballing" is inherently subjective and difficult to quantify. The concept of morphometric age derived from cross-sectional imaging has been found to correlate well with outcomes such as length of stay, morbidity, and mortality. However, the determination of the morphometric age is time intensive and requires highly trained experts. In this study, we propose a fully automated deep learning system for the segmentation of skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) on an axial computed tomography image taken at the third lumbar vertebra. We utilized a fully automated deep segmentation model derived from an extended implementation of a fully convolutional network with weight initialization of an ImageNet pre-trained model, followed by post processing to eliminate intramuscular fat for a more accurate analysis. This experiment was conducted by varying window level (WL), window width (WW), and bit resolutions in order to better understand the effects of the parameters on the model performance. Our best model, fine-tuned on 250 training images and ground truth labels, achieves 0.93~{$\pm~$}0.02 Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 3.68~{$\pm~$}2.29\% difference between predicted and ground truth muscle CSA on 150 held-out test cases. Ultimately, the fully automated segmentation system can be embedded into the clinical environment to accelerate the quantification of muscle and expanded to volume analysis of 3D datasets.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma is associated with improved survival. The Southwest Oncology Group designed a trimodality, phase II, single-arm trial with objectives of achieving a pCR rate of 40\% with prospective exploratory analyses of intratumoral molecular markers postulated to affect response and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinically staged II or III esophageal adenocarcinoma received oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) on days 1, 15, and 29; protracted-infusion fluorouracil (PI-FU) 180 mg/m(2)/d on days 8 through 43; and external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) 5 days a week at 1.8 Gy/d for 25 fractions; surgery was performed 28 to 42 days after neoadjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy was planned after surgery. Tumors were analyzed for mRNA expression and polymorphisms in genes involved in drug metabolism and DNA repair. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were evaluable. Two deaths (2.2\%) were attributable to preoperative therapy, and two deaths (2.2\%) were attributable to surgery. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were recorded for 47.3\% and 19.4\% of patients, respectively. Seventy-nine patients (84.9\%) underwent surgery; 67.7\% of patients had R0 resections. Twenty-six patients (28.0\%) had confirmed pCR (95\% CI, 19.1\% to 38.2\%). At a median follow-up of 39.2 months, estimates of median and 3-year overall survival (OS) were 28.3 months and 45.1\%, respectively. Intratumoral ERCC-1 gene expression was inversely related to progression-free survival and OS. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, PI-FU, and EBRT for esophageal adenocarcinoma is active and tolerable. Because the regimen failed to meet the primary end point, it does not define a new standard. However, future trials can be built on this platform to validate the role of ERCC-1 in determining the best systemic regimen for individual patients.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The automated segmentation of organs and tissues throughout the body using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has been rapidly increasing. Research into many medical conditions has benefited greatly from these approaches by allowing the development of more rapid and reproducible quantitative imaging markers. These markers have been used to help diagnose disease, determine prognosis, select patients for therapy, and follow responses to therapy. Because some of these tools are now transitioning from research environments to clinical practice, it is important for radiologists to become familiar with various methods used for automated segmentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Radiology Research Alliance of the Association of University Radiologists convened an Automated Segmentation Task Force to conduct a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature on this topic. RESULTS: The systematic review presented here includes 408 studies and discusses various approaches to automated segmentation using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging for neurologic, thoracic, abdominal, musculoskeletal, and breast imaging applications. CONCLUSION: These insights should help prepare radiologists to better evaluate automated segmentation tools and apply them not only to research, but eventually to clinical practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle metrics derived from computed tomography (CT) are associated with adverse health events in older persons, but obtaining these metrics using current methods is not practical for large datasets. We developed a fully automated method for muscle measurement on CT images. This study aimed to determine the relationship between muscle measurements on CT with survival in a large multicenter trial of older adults. METHOD: The relationship between baseline paraspinous skeletal muscle area (SMA) and skeletal muscle density (SMD) and survival over 6 years was determined in 6,803 men and 4,558 women (baseline age: 60-69 years) in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). The automated machine learning pipeline selected appropriate CT series, chose a single image at T12, and segmented left paraspinous muscle, recording cross-sectional area and density. Associations between SMA and SMD with all-cause mortality were determined using sex-stratified Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, race, height, weight, pack-years of smoking, and presence of diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer at enrollment. RESULTS: After a mean 6.44 {$\pm$} 1.06 years of follow-up, 635 (9.33\%) men and 265 (5.81\%) women died. In men, higher SMA and SMD were associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, in fully adjusted models. A one-unit standard deviation increase was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79, 0.91; p {$<$} .001) for SMA and HR = 0.91 (95\% CI = 0.84, 0.98; p = .012) for SMD. In women, the associations did not reach significance. CONCLUSION: Higher paraspinous SMA and SMD, automatically derived from CT exams, were associated with better survival in a large multicenter cohort of community-dwelling older men.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia-associated weight loss is poorly understood; energetically demanding tissues (eg, organ and tumor mass) and resting energy expenditure (REE) are reported to increase with advanced cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to quantify the potential contribution of increasing masses of energetically demanding tissues to REE with colorectal cancer cachexia progression. DESIGN: A longitudinal computed tomography (CT) image review was performed to quantify organ size (liver, including metastases, and spleen) and peripheral tissues (skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) during colorectal cancer cachexia progression (n = 34). Body composition was prospectively evaluated by CT and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and REE was determined by indirect calorimetry in advanced colorectal cancer patients (n = 18). RESULTS: Eleven months from death, the liver (2.3 +/- 0.7 kg) and spleen (0.32 +/- 0.2 kg) were larger than reference values. One month from death, liver weight increased to 3.0 +/- 1.5 kg (P = 0.010), spleen showed a trend to increase (P = 0.077), and concurrent losses of muscle (4.2 kg) and fat (3.5 kg) (P {$<$} 0.05) were observed. The estimated percentage of fat-free mass (FFM) occupied by the liver increased from 4.5\% to 7.0\% (P {$<$} 0.001). The most rapid loss of peripheral tissues and liver and metastases gain occurred within 3 mo of death. A positive linear relation existed between liver mass and measured whole-body REE (r(2) = 0.35, P = 0.010); because liver accounted for a larger percentage of FFM, measured REE . kg FFM(-1) . d(-1) increased (r(2) = 0.35, P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Increases in mass and in the proportion of high metabolic rate tissues, including liver and tumor, represented a cumulative incremental REE of approximately 17,700 kcal during the last 3 mo of life and may contribute substantially to cachexia-associated weight loss.},

Approximately 50-80\% of patients with esophageal cancer are malnourished at the time of diagnosis. Malnutrition enhances the risk of postoperative complications, resulting in delay of postoperative recovery and impairment of quality of life. Sixty-five patients with esophageal cancer were included. All patients who received surgery (n = 28) in the time frame between March 2009 and April 2010, the first year after the start of INS, were included in the INS intervention group. The control group (n = 37) consisted of patients who received surgery during the 3 years before the start of INS. Logistic regression analysis was used to compare differences in severity of postoperative complications using the Dindo classification. Linear regression was applied to evaluate differences in preoperative weight change. The adjusted odds ratio for developing serious complications after surgery of INS compared with the control group was 0.23 (95\% confidence interval: 0.053-0.97; P = 0.045). Benefit was mainly observed in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy before esophagectomy (n = 35). The INS program furthermore resulted in a relative preoperative weight gain in comparison with the control group of +4.8\% (P = 0.009, adjusted) in these neoadjuvant-treated patients.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention with smoking cessation starting 4 weeks before general and orthopedic surgery would reduce the frequency of postoperative complications. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Complications are a major concern after elective surgery and smokers have an increased risk. There is insufficient evidence concerning how the duration of preoperative smoking intervention affects postoperative complications. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial, conducted between February 2004 and December 2006 at 4 university-affiliated hospitals in the Stockholm region, Sweden. The outcome assessment was blinded. The follow-up period for the primary outcome was 30 days. Eligibility criteria were active daily smokers, aged 18 to 79 years. Of the 238 patients assessed, 76 refused participating, and 117 men and women undergoing surgery for primary hernia repair, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, or a hip or knee prosthesis were enrolled. INTERVENTION: Smoking cessation therapy with individual counseling and nicotine substitution started 4 weeks before surgery and continued 4 weeks postoperatively. The control group received standard care. The main outcome measure was frequency of any postoperative complication. RESULTS: An intention-to-treat analysis showed that the overall complication rate in the control group was 41\%, and in the intervention group, it was 21\% (P = 0.03). Relative risk reduction for the primary outcome of any postoperative complication was 49\% and number needed to treat was 5 (95\% CI, 3-40). An analysis per protocol showed that abstainers had fewer complications (15\%) than those who continued to smoke or only reduced smoking (35\%), although this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Perioperative smoking cessation seems to be an effective tool to reduce postoperative complications even if it is introduced as late as 4 weeks before surgery.},

Esophagectomy has historically been associated with significant levels of morbidity and mortality and as a result routine application and audit of ERAS guidelines specifically designed for esophageal resection has significant potential to improve outcomes associated with this complex procedure. METHODS: A team of international experts in the surgical management of esophageal cancer was assembled and the existing literature was identified and reviewed prior to the production of the guidelines. Well established procedure specific components of ERAS were reviewed and updated with changes relevant to esophagectomy. Procedure specific, operative and technical sections were produced utilizing the best current level of evidence. All sections were rated regarding the level of evidence and overall recommendation according to the evaluation (GRADE) system. RESULTS: Thirty-nine sections were ultimately produced and assessed for quality of evidence and recommendations. Some sections were completely new to ERAS programs due to the fact that esophagectomy is the first guideline with a thoracic component to the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The current ERAS society guidelines should be reviewed and applied in all centers looking to improve outcomes and quality associated with esophageal resection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for elderly patients with esophageal cancer (EC) remains controversial. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether elderly patients with stage II-III EC could benefit from trimodal therapy. METHODS: The selected elderly patients with stage II-III EC between 2004 and 2015 were included in a retrospective cohort study from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not they underwent surgery. The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis was used to balance the confounding factors between the two groups. The Cox regression analysis, the log-rank test, and the Kaplan-Meier curves were conducted to identify the survival benefits of different treatment regimes. RESULTS: A total of 1596 patients were included in this cohort study, in which 278 patients underwent surgery. In the combination of chemoradiotherapy and surgery group, there were more male patients, more patients aged between 75 and 79~years, and more married patients in the surgery group. Moreover, there were more patients with adenomatous carcinoma, more patients with a tumor size of less than 5~cm, and more patients with a T3~stage in the combination group. In the survival analysis, patients in the combination group had a longer overall survival (OS) and EC-specific survival (ECSS). After IPTW analysis, the survival analysis generated similar results. The competitive risk model found that our results were stable. There was still a significant difference in OS and ECSS between the combination group and chemoradiotherapy alone group for esophageal adenocarcinoma (p~{$<~$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with stage II-III EC, especially those with adenocarcinoma, could benefit from the combination of surgery and chemoradiotherapy.},

We investigated the effect of surgery plus postoperative (adjuvant) chemoradiotherapy on the survival of patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. METHODS: A total of 556 patients with resected adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction were randomly assigned to surgery plus postoperative chemoradiotherapy or surgery alone. The adjuvant treatment consisted of 425 mg of fluorouracil per square meter of body-surface area per day, plus 20 mg of leucovorin per square meter per day, for five days, followed by 4500 cGy of radiation at 180 cGy per day, given five days per week for five weeks, with modified doses of fluorouracil and leucovorin on the first four and the last three days of radiotherapy. One month after the completion of radiotherapy, two five-day cycles of fluorouracil (425 mg per square meter per day) plus leucovorin (20 mg per square meter per day) were given one month apart. RESULTS: The median overall survival in the surgery-only group was 27 months, as compared with 36 months in the chemoradiotherapy group; the hazard ratio for death was 1.35 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.66; P=0.005). The hazard ratio for relapse was 1.52 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.86; P{$<$}0.001). Three patients (1 percent) died from toxic effects of the chemoradiotherapy; grade 3 toxic effects occurred in 41 percent of the patients in the chemoradiotherapy group, and grade 4 toxic effects occurred in 32 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative chemoradiotherapy should be considered for all patients at high risk for recurrence of adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction who have undergone curative resection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimal access surgery for gastrointestinal cancer has short-term benefits but is associated with a proficiency-gain curve. The aim of this study was to define national proficiency-gain curves for minimal access colorectal and oesophagogastric surgery, and to determine the impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: All adult patients undergoing minimal access oesophageal, colonic and rectal surgery between 2002 and 2012 were identified from the Hospital Episode Statistics database. Proficiency-gain curves were created using risk-adjusted cumulative sum analysis. Change points were identified, and bootstrapping was performed with 1000 iterations to identify a confidence level. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality; secondary outcomes were 90-day mortality, reintervention, conversion and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Some 1696, 15\,008 and 16\,701 minimal access oesophageal, rectal and colonic cancer resections were performed during the study period. The change point in the proficiency-gain curve for 30-day mortality for oesophageal, rectal and colonic surgery was 19 (confidence level 98{$\cdot$}4 per cent), 20 (99{$\cdot$}2 per cent) and three (99{$\cdot$}5 per cent) procedures; the mortality rate fell from 4{$\cdot$}0 to 2{$\cdot$}0 per cent (relative risk reduction (RRR) 0{$\cdot$}50, P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}033), from 2{$\cdot$}1 to 1{$\cdot$}2 per cent (RRR 0{$\cdot$}43, P\,{$<$}\,0{$\cdot$}001) and from 2{$\cdot$}4 to 1{$\cdot$}8 per cent (RRR 0{$\cdot$}25, P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}058) respectively. The change point in the proficiency-gain curve for reintervention in oesophageal, rectal and colonic resection was 19 (98{$\cdot$}1 per cent), 32 (99{$\cdot$}5 per cent) and 26 (99{$\cdot$}2 per cent) procedures respectively. There were also significant proficiency-gain curves for 90-day mortality, conversion and length of stay. CONCLUSION: The introduction of minimal access gastrointestinal cancer surgery has been associated with a proficiency-gain curve for mortality and major morbidity at a national level. Unnecessary patient harm should be avoided by appropriate training and monitoring of new surgical techniques.},

Thus, population-wide distributions of BC remain uncertain. Purpose To demonstrate the validity of fully automated, deep learning BC analysis from abdominal CT examinations, to define demographically adjusted BC reference curves, and to illustrate the advantage of use of these curves compared with standard methods, along with their biologic significance in predicting survival. Materials and Methods After external validation and equivalency testing with manual segmentation, a fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was applied to a cross-sectional population cohort that included any outpatient without a cardiovascular disease or cancer who underwent abdominal CT examination at one of three hospitals in 2012. Demographically adjusted population reference curves were generated for each BC area. The z scores derived from these curves were compared with sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia by using {$\chi$}2 tests and used to predict 2-year survival in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included weight and body mass index (BMI). Results External validation showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99) and equivalency (P {$<$} .001) of the fully automated deep learning BC analysis method with manual segmentation. With use of the fully automated BC data from 12\,128 outpatients (mean age, 52 years; 6936 [57\%] women), age-, race-, and sex-normalized BC reference curves were generated. All BC areas varied significantly with these variables (P {$<$} .001 except for subcutaneous fat area vs age [P = .003]). Sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia demonstrated that age and race bias were not present if z scores derived from the reference curves were used (P {$<$} .001). Skeletal muscle area z scores were significantly predictive of 2-year survival (P = .04) in combined models that included BMI. Conclusion Fully automated body composition (BC) metrics vary significantly by age, race, and sex. The z scores derived from reference curves for BC parameters better capture the demographic distribution of BC compared with standard methods and can help predict survival. \textcopyright{} RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ablation and vagal-sparing esophagectomy offer the potential for reduced morbidity in patients with high-grade dysplasia or early esophageal adenocarcinoma, but neither includes a lymphadenectomy. Although adequate for intramucosal tumors, both are potentially inadequate for patients with submucosal tumor invasion given the high prevalence of nodal metastases with these lesions. Currently there is no test including endoscopic ultrasound that can accurately determine whether a small tumor is confined to the mucosa or has penetrated into the submucosa. The aim of this study was to compare the pathologic depth of invasion by endoscopic mucosal resection with findings and outcome after surgical resection to assess the accuracy and reliability of endoscopic mucosal resection for staging early esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: From 2001 to 2003, 7 patients presented with small, endoscopically visible adenocarcinomas. All underwent endoscopic mucosal resection followed by surgical resection. RESULTS: Analysis of the resected specimens confirmed that the endoscopic mucosal resection had accurately determined the depth of tumor invasion in all patients, and had completely excised the lesion in all but 1 patient (86\%). Lymph node dissection was included as part of the resection in 2 patients with submucosal invasion by endoscopic mucosal resection, and a vagal-sparing esophagectomy was used in the 5 patients with only intramucosal tumors. All patients are alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic mucosal resection accurately determines the depth of tumor invasion, and should be used as a staging procedure in patients with early esophageal cancer when therapies that do not include a lymphadenectomy are considered.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationships between computed tomography (CT)-defined skeletal muscle parameters and the systemic inflammatory response (SIR) in patients with operable primary colorectal cancer (CRC). BACKGROUND: Muscle depletion is characterized by a reduced muscle mass (myopenia) and increased infiltration by inter- and intramuscular fat (myosteatosis). It is recognized as a poor prognostic indicator in patients with cancer, but the underlying factors remain unclear. METHODS: A total of 763 patients diagnosed with CRC undergoing elective surgical resection between 2006 and 2013 were included. Image analysis of CT scans was used to calculate Lumbar skeletal muscle index (LSMI), and mean muscle attenuation (MA). The SIR was quantified by the preoperative neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and albumin levels. Correlation and multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent relationships between patient SIR and muscle characteristics. RESULTS: Patients with NLR {$>$} 3 had significantly lower LSMI and lower MA than those with NLR {$<$} 3 [LSMI = 42.07{$\mkern1mu$}cmm vs 44.27{$\mkern1mu$}cmm (P = 0.002) and MA = 30.04 Hounsfield unit (HU) vs 28.36 HU (P = 0.016)]. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high NLR [odds ratio (OR) = 1.78 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-2.45), P {$<$} 0.001] and low albumin [OR = 1.80 (95\% CI: 1.17-2.74), P = 0.007] were independent predictors of reduced muscle mass. High NLR was significantly related with a low mean MA and hence myosteatosis [OR = 1.60 (95\% CI: 1.03-2.49), P = 0.038]. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight a direct association between myopenia, myosteatosis, and the host SIR in patients with operable CRC. A better understanding of factors that regulate muscle changes such as myopenia and myosteatosis may lead to the development of novel therapies that influence a more metabolically "healthy" skeletal muscle and potentially alter cancer outcomes.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to identify the presence and length of esophagectomy proficiency gain curves in terms of short- and long-term mortality for esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between 1987 and 2010 with follow-up until 2014 were identified from a well-established, population-based, nationwide Swedish cohort study. Proficiency gain curves were created by using risk-adjusted cumulative sum analysis for 30-day, 90-day, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year all-cause and disease-specific mortality measures. Similarly, the proficiency gain curves for lymph node harvest, resection margin status, and reoperation incidence were assessed as performance-contributing factors to the observed changes in long-term survival. RESULTS: Esophagectomies in 1,821 patients with esophageal cancer were conducted by 139 surgeons. The change-point in proficiency gain curve for all-cause 30-day mortality was early, at 15 cases, when mortality decreased from 7.9\% to 3.1\% (P {$<$} .001). Later change-points, which ranged from 35 to 59 cases, were observed for 1-, 3- and 5-year mortality rates, for which all-cause mortality decreased from 34.9\% to 27.7\% (P = .011), from 47.4\% to 41.5\% (P = .049), and from 31.4\% to 19.1\% (P = .009), respectively. Similar change-points were observed in disease-specific mortality at 1 and 3 years. There was a continuous increase in lymph node harvest, which did not plateau. Also, change-points were observed for resection margin with tumor involvement at 17 cases, with a reduction from 20.9\% to 15.2\% (P = .004), and for reoperation rate at 55 cases, with a reduction from 12.6\% to 5.0\% (P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: The gain of proficiency in esophagectomy for cancer is associated with measurable changes in short- and long-term mortality results. These findings indicate a need for structured national training and mentorship programs for esophageal cancer surgery.},

METHODS: Data were collected from 30 European centres from 2000 to 2010. Among 2944 included patients, 355 patients (12.1\%) had cT2N0 disease; 285 (S) and 70 (NS), were compared in terms of short- and long-term outcomes. Propensity score matching analyses were used to compensate for differences in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: No significant differences between the groups were shown in terms of in hospital morbidity and mortality. Nodal disease was observed in 50\% of S-group at the time of surgery, with 20\% pN2/N3. Utilisation of neoadjuvant therapy was associated with significant tumour downstaging as reflected by increases in pT0, pN0 and pTNM stage 0 disease, this effect was further enhanced with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. After adjustment on propensity score and confounding factors, for all patients and subset analysis of squamous cell and adenocarcinoma, neoadjuvant therapy had no significant effect upon survival or recurrence (overall, loco-regional, distant or mixed) compared to surgery alone. There were no significant differences between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in short- or long-term outcomes. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that a surgery alone treatment approach should be recommended as the primary treatment approach for cT2N0 oesophageal cancer despite 50\% of patients having nodal disease at the time of surgery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Combined chemoradiotherapy is increasingly being used as definitive treatment for locoregional esophageal malignancy. Patients with residual or recurrent localized cancer are often selectively considered for salvage esophagectomy (SALV). The aim of this pooled analysis was to compare short-term clinical outcomes from SALV following definitive chemoradiotherapy with those from planned esophagectomy following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRS). METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, trial registries, conference proceedings and reference lists were searched for relevant comparative studies. Primary outcome measures were in-hospital mortality, anastomotic leak and pulmonary complications. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay, negative (R0) resection margin, and estimated blood loss. RESULTS: Eight studies comprising 954 patients; 242 (SALV) and 712 (NCRS) were included. SALV was associated with a significantly increased incidence of post-operative mortality (9.50 vs. 4.07 \%; pooled odds ratio [POR] = 3.02; p {$<$} 0.001), anastomotic leak (23.97 vs. 14.47 \%; POR = 1.99; p = 0.005), pulmonary complications (29.75 vs. 16.99 \%; POR = 2.12; p {$<$} 0.001), and an increased length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference = 8.29 days; 95 \% CI 7.08-9.5; p {$<$} 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of negative resection margins or estimated blood loss. CONCLUSIONS: SALV has poorer short-term outcomes when compared with planned esophagectomy following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and multidisciplinary tumor boards should be made aware of these differences in outcomes and SALV should be reserved for practice in high-volume institutions.},

METHODS: A nationwide cohort study was conducted in Sweden in 2001-2004, with follow-up to 2008. Weight was assessed before oesophagectomy, after 6 months and at 3 years. Logistic regression was performed with adjustment for confounders. Odds ratios (ORs) for postoperative weight loss of at least 15 per cent were estimated. RESULTS: Some 203 patients survived at least 3 years after oesophagectomy. Continuous weight loss occurred for up to 3 years. Women and men had a similar risk of malnutrition after 3 years (OR 0.85 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.24 to 2.98)). In overweight patients (preoperative body mass index at least 25 kg/m(2)) the risk of malnutrition was increased almost fivefold at 6 months (OR 4.90 (2.27 to 10.59)) and 3 years (OR 4.60 (1.80 to 11.78)). There was no difference in weight loss at 6 months between survivors and those who died between 6 months and 3 years after surgery (OR 1.11 (0.64 to 1.94)). CONCLUSION: Weight loss can be long lasting after oesophagectomy; overweight patients are at particularly increased risk of malnutrition.},

The aim of this population-based study was to identify such risk factors. METHODS: Data were collected from a nationwide Swedish organization for research on surgery for oesophageal cancer. A total of 340 patients (75.9 per cent of those eligible) responded to a study-specific questionnaire concerning height and weight, just before and 6 months after surgery. Factors influencing malnutrition, defined as loss of body mass index of at least 15 per cent 6 months after operation, were identified by logistic regression. RESULTS: Neoadjuvant therapy (received by 10.6 per cent of all patients) and female sex were associated with at least a twofold increased risk of weight loss (odds ratio (OR) 2.41 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.01 to 5.77) and 2.14 (1.07 to 4.28) respectively), whereas preoperative weight loss was associated with a decreased risk (OR 0.13 (0.03 to 0.65)). Age, tumour stage and location, type of oesophageal substitute, suture technique and postoperative complications did not influence the risk. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant therapy and female sex appear to be associated with an increased risk of malnutrition after oesophageal cancer surgery.},

The aim of this study was to estimate weight change after surgery in a population-based setting and to identify nutritional problems that might correlate with weight loss. METHODS: Data were collected through the Swedish Esophageal and Cardia Cancer Register, a nationwide registry of oesophageal cancer surgery. Patients who underwent oesophageal cancer surgery between 2001 and 2004 were followed up until April 2005, and data on patient and tumour characteristics and surgical treatment were collected. Six months after surgery the patients were asked to complete a questionnaire about weight and a health-related quality of life questionnaire (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) with an oesophageal-specific module (EORTC QLQ-OES18)). RESULTS: The response rate to the questionnaire was 76.9 per cent and weight change in 226 patients was analysed. Six months after operation 63.7 per cent had lost more than 10 per cent of their preoperative BMI, and 20.4 per cent had lost more than 20 per cent. Appetite loss, eating difficulties and odynophagia were significantly linked to postoperative weight loss, whereas dysphagia or reflux did not correlate with malnutrition. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is a considerable problem after oesophagectomy, and is linked to appetite loss, eating difficulties and odynophagia.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Emerging evidence suggests muscle depletion predicts survival of patients with cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At a cancer center in Alberta, Canada, consecutive patients with cancer (lung or GI; N = 1,473) were assessed at presentation for weight loss history, lumbar skeletal muscle index, and mean muscle attenuation (Hounsfield units) by computed tomography (CT). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Concordance (c) statistics were used to test predictive accuracy of survival models. RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI) distribution was 17\% obese, 35\% overweight, 36\% normal weight, and 12\% underweight. Patients in all BMI categories varied widely in weight loss, muscle index, and muscle attenuation. Thresholds defining associations between these three variables and survival were determined using optimal stratification. High weight loss, low muscle index, and low muscle attenuation were independently prognostic of survival. A survival model containing conventional covariates (cancer diagnosis, stage, age, performance status) gave a c statistic of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.79), whereas a model ignoring conventional variables and including only BMI, weight loss, muscle index, and muscle attenuation gave a c statistic of 0.92 (95\% CI, 0.88 to 0.95; P {$<$} .001). Patients who possessed all three of these poor prognostic variables survived 8.4 months (95\% CI, 6.5 to 10.3), regardless of whether they presented as obese, overweight, normal weight, or underweight, in contrast to patients who had none of these features, who survived 28.4 months (95\% CI, 24.2 to 32.6; P {$<$} .001). CONCLUSION: CT images reveal otherwise occult muscle depletion. Patients with cancer who are cachexic by the conventional criterion (involuntary weight loss) and by two additional criteria (muscle depletion and low muscle attenuation) share a poor prognosis, regardless of overall body weight.},

We investigated the prevalence of computed tomography (CT)-defined sarcopenia and myosteatosis across different levels of nutrition risk assessed by the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment Short Form (PG-SGA SF). We also evaluated whether the PG-SGA SF, sarcopenia, and myosteatosis were prognostic of overall survival. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study. Consecutive patients with body mass index {$\geq$}25.0 kg/m2 with newly diagnosed head and neck cancer (any stage) or lung and gastrointestinal tract cancer (locally recurrent or metastatic) were screened at presentation to oncology clinics. Nutrition risk was assigned based on PG-SGA SF triage recommendations. Based on CT, patients were classified with sarcopenia and/or myosteatosis using published cutoffs. Survival analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Patients (n=1157) were 63.6 {$\pm$} 11.4 years, 64\% male, and 61\% had stage IV disease. Sarcopenia and myosteatosis were prevalent across PG-SGA SF nutrition risk categories (scores 0-1 [no risk; 36\% sarcopenic; 44\% myosteatotic], scores 2-3 [37\%; 37\%], scores 4-8 [40\%; 41\%], and scores {$\geq$}9 [high risk; 50\%; 49\%]). In multivariable survival analysis, PG-SGA SF scores {$\geq$}9 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.08, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.66-2.60, P{$<$}0.001), sarcopenia (HR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.06-1.46, P=0.006), and myosteatosis (HR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.07-1.46, P{$<$}0.001) independently predicted reduced survival.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, visceral obesity (VO), and reduced muscle radiodensity (myosteatosis) are suggested risk factors for postoperative morbidity in colorectal cancer (CRC), but usually are not concurrently assessed. Published thresholds used to define these features are not CRC-specific and are defined in relation to mortality, not postoperative outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate body composition in relation to length of hospital stay (LOS) and postoperative outcomes. METHODS: Pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) images were assessed for total area and radiodensity of skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue in a pooled Canadian and UK cohort (n\,=\,2100). Sex- and age-specific values for these features were calculated. For 1139 of 2100 patients, LOS data were available, and sex- and age-specific thresholds for sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and VO were defined on the basis of LOS. Association of CT-defined features with LOS and readmissions was explored using negative binomial and logistic regression models, respectively. RESULTS: In the multivariable analysis, the predictors of LOS (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) were age, surgical approach, major complications (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.42; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.18-2.68), study cohort, and three body composition profiles characterized by myosteatosis combined with either sarcopenia (IRR, 1.27; 95\% CI 1.12-1.43) or VO (IRR, 1.25; 95\% CI 1.10-1.42), and myosteatosis combined with both sarcopenia and VO (IRR, 1.58; 95\% CI 1.29-1.93). In the multivariable analysis, risk of readmission was associated with VO alone (odds ratio [OR] 2.66; 95\% CI 1.18-6.00); P\,=\,0.018), VO combined with myosteatosis (OR, 2.72; 95\% CI 1.36-5.46; P\,=\,0.005), or VO combined with myosteatosis and sarcopenia (OR, 2.98; 95\% CI 1.06-5.46; P\,=\,0.038). Importantly, the effect of body composition profiles on LOS and readmission was independent of major complications. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that CT-defined multidimensional body habitus is independently associated with LOS and hospital readmission.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether elements of a standard nutritional screening assessment are independently prognostic of survival in patients with advanced cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective nested cohort of patients with metastatic cancer were accrued from different units of a Regional Palliative Care Program. Patients completed a nutritional screen on admission. Data included age, sex, cancer site, height, weight history, dietary intake, 13 nutrition impact symptoms, and patient- and physician-reported performance status (PS). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted. Concordance statistics (c-statistics) were used to test the predictive accuracy of models based on training and validation sets; a c-statistic of 0.5 indicates the model predicts the outcome as well as chance; perfect prediction has a c-statistic of 1.0. RESULTS: A training set of patients in palliative home care (n = 1,164) was used to identify prognostic variables. Primary disease site, PS, short-term weight change (either gain or loss), dietary intake, and dysphagia predicted survival in multivariate analysis (P {$<$} .05). A model including only patients separated by disease site and PS with high c-statistics between predicted and observed responses for survival in the training set (0.90) and validation set (0.88; n = 603). The addition of weight change, dietary intake, and dysphagia did not further improve the c-statistic of the model. The c-statistic was also not altered by substituting physician-rated palliative PS for patient-reported PS. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a high probability of concordance between predicted and observed survival for patients in distinct palliative care settings (home care, tertiary inpatient, ambulatory outpatient) based on patient-reported information.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify factors influencing postoperative weight loss {$\geq$}15~\% in long-term survivors after esophageal cancer surgery. METHODS: A population-based study was conducted in Sweden between 2001 and 2005, with regular follow-up for 5~years. Current weight, weight at operation, and average weight were assessed and dichotomized as weight loss of {$\geq$}15~\%. Logistic regression estimated relative risks of weight loss between pre- and 5~years postoperatively, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95~\% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistically significant differences in nutritional symptoms between weight loss groups were analyzed using linear regression models to likewise test as risk factors. Body mass index (BMI) at operation ({$<$} or {$\geq$}25), sex, and preoperative weight loss ({$<$} or {$\geq$}10~\%) were tested as risk factors. Nutritional symptoms were selected from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES18, including fatigue, nausea and vomiting, dyspnoea, appetite loss, diarrhea, and dysphagia, eating difficulties, reflux and pain. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were included. Patients with preoperative BMI {$\geq$}25 were at a threefold increased risk (OR 3.2; 95~\% CI 1.4-7.3) for postoperative weight loss of {$\geq$}15~\% 5~years after operation. Moreover, eating difficulties, pain, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and appetite loss were clinically relevant and statistically significantly worse symptoms experienced among those with a weight loss of {$\geq$}15~\% (all at p~{$<~$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Overweight at the time of operation is associated with postoperative weight loss from a long-term perspective. Several nutritional symptoms are associated with weight loss of {$>$}15~\% 5~years postoperatively.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Existing definitions of clinically important weight loss (WL) in patients with cancer are unclear and heterogeneous and do not consider current trends toward obesity. METHODS: Canadian and European patients with cancer (n = 8,160) formed a population-based data set. Body mass index (BMI) and percent WL (\%WL) were recorded, and patients were observed prospectively until death. Data were entered into a multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, cancer site, stage, and performance status. Relationships for BMI and \%WL to overall survival were examined to develop a grading system. RESULTS: Mean overall \%WL was -9.7\% {$\pm$} 8.4\% and BMI was 24.4 {$\pm$} 5.1 kg/m(2), and both \%WL and BMI independently predicted survival (P {$<$} .01). Differences in survival were observed across five categories of BMI ({$<$} 20.0, 20.0 to 21.9, 22.0 to 24.9, 25.0 to 27.9, and {$\geq$} 28.0 kg/m(2); P {$<$} .001) and five categories of \%WL (-2.5\% to -5.9\%, -6.0\% to -10.9\%, -11.0\% to -14.9\%, {$\geq$} -15.0\%, and weight stable ({$\pm$} 2.4\%); P {$<$} .001). A 5 \texttimes{} 5 matrix representing the five \%WL categories within each of the five BMI categories was graded based on median survival and prognostic significance. Weight-stable patients with BMI {$\geq$} 25.0 kg/m(2) (grade 0) had the longest survival (20.9 months; 95\% CI, 17.9 to 23.9 months), and \%WL values associated with lowered categories of BMI were related to shorter survival (P {$<$} .001), as follows: grade 1, 14.6 months (95\% CI, 12.9 to 16.2 months); grade 2, 10.8 months (95\% CI, 9.7 to 11.9 months); grade 3, 7.6 months (95\% CI, 7.0 to 8.2 months); and grade 4, 4.3 months (95\% CI, 4.1 to 4.6 months). Survival discrimination by grade was observed within specific cancers, stages, ages, and performance status and in an independent validation sample (n = 2,963). CONCLUSION: A robust grading system incorporating the independent prognostic significance of both BMI and \%WL was developed.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Postoperative sarcopenia following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer has become a severe problem due to the increasing number of elderly patients undergoing surgery. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between early postoperative skeletal muscle change and cancer prognosis, and propose effective interventions to prevent sarcopenia. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 152 patients who underwent esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. Total psoas muscle area (TPA) was measured before surgery as baseline and on postoperative day 7 ({$\pm~$}2). The effect of early postoperative skeletal muscle loss on 5-year survival was investigated. Moreover, 5-year survival in patients with postoperative complications and a high inflammatory status, which were previously reported as poor prognostic factors of esophageal cancer, was also investigated. RESULTS: Among the 152 patients, 52 (34.2\%) showed a decrease in TPA, while 100 (65.8\%) maintained their TPA. The TPA decreasing group exhibited poor 5-year overall survival (OS) (p~=~0.003) and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p~{$<~$}0.001). The TPA decreasing group also showed a poor 5-year OS in patients who developed severe postoperative complications (p~=~0.015). Multivariate analyses showed that decreased TPA was found to be independently associated with OS (p~=~0.017) as well as RFS (p~=~0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested a relationship between decreased TPA within 1~week after esophagectomy and long-term prognosis among patients with esophageal cancer. If TPA can be maintained, the prognosis was better even in cases with serious complications.},

Patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal and breast cancer who were over 18 years old and were scheduled to undergo adjuvant treatment at Hospital Borges da Costa/Brazil were evaluated. The exclusion criteria were neoadjuvant treatment, patients with kidney and liver disease and using diuretics. Weight, HGS and PA tests were performed by trained dietitians. The KaplanMeier survival method and the log-rank test, cox regression and ROC curve were used and p {$<$} 0.05 was considered significant. Two-hundred and twenty-eight patients were evaluated.The median survival time was higher among the patients who showed weight loss of less than 10\% of usual body weight (p {$<$} 0.05). Regarding HGS, patients with decreased HGS had a 22.0 month survival versus 34.2 months for those with normal values (p {$<$} 0.05). 146 patients had normal PA values, and these patients had increased survival time compared to those with inappropriate values (p {$<$} 0.05). In the Cox regression, weight loss and PA were predictors of mortality, HGS wasn't significantly associated with mortality.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The influence of preoperative hemoglobin levels on outcomes of patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer is not clearly defined. The goal of this article was to explore the association between combined modality therapy, preoperative anemia status, and perioperative blood transfusion and risk of postoperative complications among patients undergoing esophageal resection. METHODS: From a retrospective esophageal database, 413 patients were identified. Anemia was defined according to the World Health Organization classification of {$<$}13 g/dL or {$<$}12 g/dL for men or women, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance, Pearson's chi(2), or Fisher exact test as appropriate. The independent association of anemia, blood transfusion, and combined modality treatment on risk of postoperative complications were examined using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Information on combined modality treatment, preoperative hemoglobin levels, and blood transfusion was available for 413 patients, of whom 57\% received combined modality treatment. Overall 197 (47.6\%) patients were preoperatively found to be anemic, and those who had received combined modality treatment were more likely to be anemic (60.6\% versus 30.7\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Anemic patients required more blood transfusions than nonanemic patients (46.7\% versus 29.6\%, P {$<$} 0.001). Seventy-five percent of patients who required transfusion during the hospital stay had received combined modality treatment (P = 0.01). Combined modality treatment and anemia were not associated with increased risk of complications. Patients with any perioperative complication and surgical site infections were more likely to have received blood transfusion compared to patients without complications (OR = 1.73; 95\% CI 1.04-2.87 and OR = 2.98; 95\% CI 1.04-8.55; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we determined that administration of neoadjuvant treatment to esophageal cancer patients was not associated with an increased rate of perioperative complications. Preoperative anemia did not predict worsened short-term outcomes, but increased the chances of red blood cell transfusion, which were significantly associated with higher overall complications and increased risk of surgical site infections. These data confirm previous studies that allogenic red blood cell transfusions are independent risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality and should be minimized during surgery for esophageal cancer.},

DESIGN: Prospective observational study of rectal cancers treated by colorectal multidisciplinary teams between January 2002 and October 2003. SETTING: 11 colorectal units in four European countries. PARTICIPANTS: 408 consecutive patients presenting with all stages of rectal cancer and undergoing magnetic resonance imaging before total mesorectal excision surgery and histopathological assessment of the surgical specimen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in predicting a curative resection based on the histological yardstick of presence or absence of tumour at the margins of the specimen. RESULTS: 354 of the 408 patients had a clear circumferential resection margin (87\%, 95\% confidence interval 83\% to 90\%). Specificity for prediction of a clear margin by magnetic resonance imaging was 92\% (327/354, 90\% to 95\%). High resolution scans were technically satisfactory in 93\% (379/408). Surgical specimens were histopathologically graded as complete or moderate in 80\% (328/408), and the median lymph node harvest was 12 (range 0-49). Magnetic resonance imaging predicted clear margins in 349 patients. At surgery 327 had clear margins (94\%, 91\% to 96\%). CONCLUSION: High resolution magnetic resonance imaging accurately predicts whether the surgical resection margins will be clear or affected by tumour. This technique can be reproduced accurately in multiple centres to predict curative resection and warns the multidisciplinary team of potential failure of surgery, thus enabling selection of patients for preoperative treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Often curative treatment for locally advanced resectable esophageal or gastro-esophageal junctional cancer consists of concurrent neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by surgery. Currently, one of the most commonly used chemotherapy regimens in this setting is a combination of a fluoropyrimidin and of a platinum analogue. Due to the promising results of the recent CROSS trial, another regimen combining paclitaxel and carboplatin is also widely used by European and American centers. No clinical study has shown the superiority of one treatment over the other. The objective of this Phase II study is to clarify clinical practice by comparing these two chemotherapy treatments. Our aim is to evaluate, in operable esophageal and gastro-esophageal junctional cancer, the complete resection rate and severe postoperative morbidity rate associated with these two neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic regimens (carboplatin-paclitaxel or fluorouracil-oxaliplatin-folinic acid) when each is combined with the radiation regime utilized in the CROSS trial. METHODS/DESIGN: PROTECT is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open arms, phase II trial. Eligible patients will have a histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and be treated with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy followed by surgery for stage IIB or stage III resectable esophageal cancer. A total of 106 patients will be randomized to receive either 3~cycles of FOLFOX combined to concurrent radiotherapy (41.4 Grays) or carboplatin and paclitaxel with the same radiation regimen, using a 1:1 allocation ratio. DISCUSSION: This ongoing trial offers the unique opportunity to compare two standards of chemotherapy delivered with a common regimen of preoperative radiation, in the setting of operable locally advanced esophageal or gastro-esophageal junctional tumors.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy induces a systemic inflammatory response whose extent has been recognized as a predictive factor of postoperative respiratory morbidity. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a protective ventilatory strategy to reduce systemic inflammation in patients undergoing esophagectomy. METHODS: The authors prospectively investigated 52 patients undergoing planned esophagectomy for cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to a conventional ventilation strategy (n = 26; tidal volume of 9 ml/kg during two-lung and one-lung ventilation; no positive end-expiratory pressure) or a protective ventilation strategy (n = 26; tidal volume of 9 ml/kg during two-lung ventilation, reduced to 5 ml/kg during one-lung ventilation; positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O throughout the operative time). RESULTS: Plasmatic levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured perioperatively and postoperatively. Pulmonary function and postoperative evolution were also evaluated. Patients who received protective strategy had lower blood levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 at the end of one-lung ventilation (0.24 [0.15-0.40] vs. 0.56 [0.38-0.89] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; 91 [61-117] vs. 189 [127-294] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; and 30 [22-45] vs. 49 [29-69] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.05, respectively) and 18 h postoperatively (0.18 [0.13-0.30] vs. 0.43 [0.34-0.54] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; 54 [36-89] vs. 116 [78-208] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001; 16 [11-24] vs. 35 [28-53] pg/ml, P {$<$} 0.001, respectively). Protective strategy resulted in higher oxygen partial pressure to inspired oxygen fraction ratio during one-lung ventilation and 1 h postoperatively and in a reduction of postoperative mechanical ventilation duration (115 +/- 38 vs. 171 +/- 57 min, P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSION: A protective ventilatory strategy decreases the proinflammatory systemic response after esophagectomy, improves lung function, and results in earlier extubation.},

Emptying of the esophageal substitute was assessed by scintigraphy using a 99Tc-labeled solid test meal. The data were compared with measurements performed in 14 controls, in 7 of whom gastric emptying was measured. The gastric emptying half time was 6.8 +/- 6.2 min (median 144 s) in ER cases, significantly shorter than in controls: 70 +/- 29 min (median 51 min). The early integrated (first 30 min) and total integrated insulin and GLP-1 concentrations were significantly higher than in controls. In 3 of 10 esophagectomy patients the blood glucose concentration fell below 3.8 mmol/l postprandially. High GLP-1 concentrations in the first 30 min were associated with low serum glucose during the 2nd h postprandially when all the hypoglycemic episodes occurred. It is concluded that rapid emptying of the esophageal substitute induces the exaggerated GLP-1 response, which is a main factor for reactive hypoglycemia.},

  abstract = {Aim Progression of cachexia indicated by decreased body weight and composition is associated with poor survival of advanced pancreatic cancer (APC). There are limited data concerning the prognostic effect of cachexia on second-line chemotherapy (L2). We aimed to assess the impact of cachexia progression during first-line therapy (L1) on survival after L2. Methods We reviewed patients with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GEM/nabPTX)-refractory APC who underwent L2 with modified FOLFIRINOX or S-1 between 2015 and 2019 in our institution. We determined clinicopathological data including body composition parameters: subcutaneous fat area (SFA), visceral fat area (VFA), and skeletal muscle index (SMI). Correlations of changes in these parameters, as well as their effect on overall survival after L2 (OS2), were examined. Results Median rates of change in SMI, SFA, and VFA were 0.19\%, -4.17\%, and -18.39\%, respectively, in 59 patients during L1. Although there was moderate correlation in rate of change between SFA and VFA, there was no correlation between SMI and other parameters. We defined loss of SFA, VFA, and SMI as decreases greater than 8.5\%, 34.1\%, and 8.7\%, respectively. Median OS2 of patients with loss in any of these parameters was significantly shorter than in patients without loss (3.83 vs. 8.73 months). Multivariate analysis revealed that loss in any parameters, performance status, and C-reactive protein/albumin ratio were independent negative prognostic factors. Conclusion Loss of adipose tissue or skeletal muscle during L1 had a considerable impact on OS2 in APC refractory to GEM/nabPTX.},

  abstract = {Background Self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) insertion and percutaneous gastrostomy (PG) feeding are commonly used for patients with esophageal cancer and dysphagia. This study aimed to compare outcomes between SEMS insertion and PG feeding for them. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 308 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent fully covered SEMS insertion (stent group) or PG (gastrostomy group) for dysphagia due to tumor. Patients with other causes of dysphagia, such as radiation-induced or postoperative stricture, were excluded from the study. Clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups, including overall survival and need for additional intervention and postprocedural nutritional status. Results At baseline, the stent group (n = 169) had more stage IV patients, less cervical cancers, and received radiotherapy and esophagectomy less often than the gastrostomy group (n = 64). The Kaplan-Meier curves showed higher overall survival in the gastrostomy group than in the stent group. Multivariate analysis revealed that PG was associated with better survival compared with SEMS insertion (hazard ratio 0.541, 95\% confidence interval 0.346\textendash 0.848, p = 0.007). In addition, the gastrostomy group needed additional intervention less often (3.1\% vs. 21.9\%, p {$<$} 0.001) and experienced less decrease in serum albumin levels (-0.15 {$\pm$} 0.56 g/dL vs. -0.39 {$\pm$} 0.58 g/dL, p = 0.011) than the stent group after procedure. Conclusions Our data suggested that, compared with SEMS insertion, PG is associated with better overall survival in patients with esophageal cancer and dysphagia. Stabilized nutritional status by PG may play a role in improving patient survival.},

Prehabilitation, a preoperative conditioning intervention aiming to optimize physical status, has not been tested in upper gastrointestinal surgery to date. Objective: To investigate whether prehabilitation is effective in improving functional status in patients undergoing esophagogastric cancer resection. Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized clinical trial (available-case analysis based on completed assessments) was conducted at McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) comparing prehabilitation with a control group. Intervention consisted of preoperative exercise and nutrition optimization. Participants were adults awaiting elective esophagogastric resection for cancer. The study dates were February 13, 2013, to February 10, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in functional capacity, measured with absolute change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). Preoperative (end of the prehabilitation period) and postoperative (from 4 to 8 weeks after surgery) data were compared between groups. Results: Sixty-eight patients were randomized, and 51 were included in the primary analysis. The control group were a mean (SD) age, 68.0 (11.6) years and 20 (80\%) men. Patients in the prehabilitation group were a mean (SD) age, 67.3 (7.4) years and 18 (69\%) men. Compared with the control group, the prehabilitation group had improved functional capacity both before surgery (mean [SD] 6MWD change, 36.9 [51.4] vs -22.8 [52.5] m; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and after surgery (mean [SD] 6MWD change, 15.4 [65.6] vs -81.8 [87.0] m; P\,{$<$}\,.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Prehabilitation improves perioperative functional capacity in esophagogastric surgery. Keeping patients from physical and nutritional status decline could have a significant effect on the cancer care continuum. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01666158.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 236 patients with clinical stage T1 to T4, N0/1, M0 squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma selected for a nonsurgical approach, after stratification by weight loss, primary tumor size, and histology, were randomized to receive combined-modality therapy consisting of four monthly cycles of fluorouracil (5-FU) (1,000 mg/m(2)/24 hours for 4 days) and cisplatin (75 mg/m(2) bolus day 1) with concurrent 64.8 Gy versus the same chemotherapy schedule but with concurrent 50.4 Gy. The trial was stopped after an interim analysis. The median follow-up was 16.4 months for all patients and 29.5 months for patients still alive. RESULTS: For the 218 eligible patients, there was no significant difference in median survival (13.0 v 18.1 months), 2-year survival (31\% v 40\%), or local/regional failure and local/regional persistence of disease (56\% v 52\%) between the high-dose and standard-dose arms. Although 11 treatment-related deaths occurred in the high-dose arm compared with two in the standard-dose arm, seven of the 11 deaths occurred in patients who had received 50.4 Gy or less. CONCLUSION: The higher radiation dose did not increase survival or local/regional control. Although there was a higher treatment-related mortality rate in the patients assigned to the high-dose radiation arm, it did not seem to be related to the higher radiation dose. The standard radiation dose for patients treated with concurrent 5-FU and cisplatin chemotherapy is 50.4 Gy.},

Earlier MRI and CT validation studies used data-acquisition techniques and data-analysis procedures now outdated, evaluated anatomic rather than adipose tissue-free skeletal muscle (ATFSM), studied only the relatively large thigh, or found unduly large estimation errors. The aim of the present study was to compare arm and leg ATFSM cross-sectional area estimates (cm2) by using standard MRI and CT acquisition and image-analysis methods with corresponding cadaver estimates. A second objective was to validate MRI and CT measurements of adipose tissue embedded within muscle (interstitial adipose tissue) and surrounding muscle (subcutaneous adipose tissue). ATFSM area (n = 119) by MRI [38.9 +/- 22.3 (SD) cm2], CT (39.7 +/- 22.8 cm2), and cadaver (39.5 +/- 23.0 cm2) were not different (P {$>$} 0.001), and both MRI and CT estimates of ATFSM were highly correlated with corresponding cadaver values [MRI: r = 0.99, SE of estimate (SEE) 3.9 cm2, P {$<$} 0.001; and CT: r = 0.99, SEE = 3.8 cm2, P {$<$} 0.001]. Similarly good results were observed between MRI- and CT-measured vs. cadaver-measured interstitial and subcutaneous adipose tissue. For MRI-ATFSM the intraobserver correlation for duplicate measurements in vivo was 0. 99 [SEE = 8.7 cm2 (2.9\%), P {$<$} 0.001]. These findings strongly support the use of MRI and CT as reference methods for appendicular skeletal muscle, interstitial and subcutaneous adipose tissue measurement in vivo.},

There were no significant differences in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) associated with skeletal muscle mass before chemotherapy. However, 22 patients with skeletal muscle loss ({$>$}5\%) after chemotherapy showed significantly shorter PFS and OS compared with those without skeletal muscle loss (PFS, log-rank p = 0.029; OS, log-rank p = 0.009). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that skeletal muscle loss after chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 2.079; 95\% confidence interval, 1.194\textendash 3.619; p = 0.010) was independently associated with OS.

The aim of this study was to determine whether contrast media phase, radiation dose, and slice thickness in CT affect body composition segmentation. METHODS: Clinically indicated perfusion CTs of the upper abdomen in 20 patients (seven women) between 40 and 87 y of age with high suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed retrospectively. Axial images from the L3 level with varying imaging delay were reconstructed after contrast media injection (18 images per patient), slice thickness (5 images, 2-10 mm), and radiation dose (4 images with one-third to four-thirds of standard dose). Muscle and fat areas were segmented semiautomatically by drawing regions of interests and using established cutoff thresholds. Skeletal muscle index (SMI), steatotic muscle area, and adipose tissue index, as well as muscle attenuation and fat attenuation, were evaluated. RESULTS: Average SMI increased by up to 2.8\% after contrast media injection. Steatotic muscle area decreased by {$\leq$}13.8\%, and adipose tissue index decreased by {$\leq$}6.5\%. Muscle attenuation increased after contrast media injection, whereas fat attenuation decreased (all P {$<$} 0.001). SMI decreased by 1.9\% on average when increasing slice thickness from 2 to 10 mm. Steatotic muscle area increased by {$\leq$}3.3\%, and adipose tissue index increased by {$\leq$}1.5\% (all P {$<$} 0.05). Muscle attenuation did not change significantly with reconstruction thickness. Radiation dose had no effect on estimated area of spinal muscle, fatty spinal muscle, or visceral fat. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast media have a strong effect on the evaluation of body composition, whereas the influence of slice thickness is less pronounced. Radiation dose can be reduced by {$\geq$}66\% without significantly affecting segmentation.},

Our objective was to evaluate clinically accessible methods to achieve practical and precise measures of body composition in cancer patients. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-based analysis of fat and fat-free mass was performed in 50 cancer patients and compared with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and with regional computed tomography (CT) images available in the patients' medical records. BIA overestimated or underestimated fat-free mass substantially compared with DXA as the method of reference (up to 9.3 kg difference). Significant changes in fat-free mass over time detected with DXA in a subset of 21 patients (+2.2 +/- 3.2\%/100 days, p = 0.003), was beyond the limits of detection of BIA. Regional analysis of fat and fat-free tissue at the 3rd lumbar vertebra with either DXA or CT strongly predicted whole-body fat and fat-free mass (r = 0.86-0.94; p {$<$} 0.001). CT images provided detail on specific muscles, adipose tissues and organs, not provided by DXA or BIA. CT presents great practical significance due to the prevalence of these images in patient diagnosis and follow-up, thus marrying clinical accessibility with high precision to quantify specific tissues and to predict whole-body composition.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Low muscle attenuation, as governed by increased intramuscular fat infiltration (myosteatosis), may associate with adverse surgical outcomes. We aimed to determine whether myosteatosis is associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications and reduced long-term survival after oesophago-gastric (OG) cancer surgery. METHODS: Patients who underwent radical OG cancer surgery with preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging were included. Myosteatosis was evaluated using previously defined cut-points for low skeletal muscle attenuation measured by CT. Oncological, surgical, complications, and outcome data were obtained from a prospective database. RESULTS: Of 108 patients, 56\% (n\,=\,61) had myosteatosis. Patients with myosteatosis were older (69.1\,{$\pm$}\,9.1 vs. 62.8\,{$\pm$}\,9.8 years, p\,=\,0.001) and had a similar body mass index (BMI) (23.4\,{$\pm$}\,5.3 vs. 25.9\,{$\pm$}\,6.7\,kg/m2, p\,=\,0.766) compared to patients with normal muscle attenuation. Patients with myosteatosis had a higher rate of anastomotic leaks (15\% vs. 2\%, p\,=\,0.041). On multivariate analysis, myosteatosis was an independent predictor of overall (OR 3.03, 95\% CI 1.31-6.99, p\,=\,0.009) and severe complications (OR 4.33, 95\% CI 1.26-14.9, p\,=\,0.020). Patients with myosteatosis had reduced 5 year overall (54.1\% vs. 83\%, p\,=\,0.004) and disease-free (55.2\% vs. 87.2\%, p\,=\,0.007) survival. CONCLUSION: Myosteatosis is associated with a significantly increased risk of overall and severe complications as well as substantially reduced long-term survival. Assessment of muscle attenuation provides analysis beyond standard anthropometrics and may form part of preoperative physiological staging tools used to improve surgical outcomes.},

  abstract = {Esophagectomy causes postprandial symptoms associated with an exaggerated postprandial gut hormone response. This study aimed to compare the gastrointestinal transit time of patients 1~year after esophagectomy with unoperated controls, including its relation to satiety gut hormone release. In this cross-sectional study, consecutive, disease-free patients after esophagectomy with pyloroplasty were compared with unoperated control subjects to assess gastric emptying (GE) and cecal arrival time (CAT). Serial plasma samples were collected before, and for 300~minutes after, a mixed-meal challenge. Body composition was assessed, and symptom scores were calculated. Eleven patients 1~year post-esophagectomy (age: 62.6\,{$\pm$}\,9.8, male: 82\%) did not show a significantly different GE pattern compared with 10 control subjects (P\,=\,0.245). Rather, patients could be categorized bimodally as exhibiting either rapid or slow GE relative to controls. Those with rapid GE trended toward a higher postprandial symptom burden (P\,=\,0.084) without higher postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion (P\,=\,0.931). CAT was significantly shorter after esophagectomy (P\,=\,0.043) but was not significantly associated with GE, GLP-1 secretion, or symptom burden. Neither early nutrient delivery to the proximal small intestine nor to the colon explains the exaggerated postprandial GLP-1 response after esophagectomy. GE varies significantly in these patients despite consistent pyloric management.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) have an uncertain prognosis. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the prognostic potential of a skeletal muscle mass reduction index measured by computed tomography (CT) for mUC patients undergoing second-line gemcitabine and docetaxel (GD) chemotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 44 patients with mUC who received second-line GD chemotherapy between 2006 and 2015 in our hospital. Skeletal muscle area (SMA) at the third lumbar vertebra was measured using CT images obtained from medical records, and a skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated for each patient as: SMI = SMA / height2. Changes in SMI across timepoints (SMI inclination) were calculated as: SMI inclination = [( SMI/SMI)/duration of the interval between imaging visits]. Patients were then divided into two groups: a "steep" group (SMI inclination {$<$} -0.01) and a "gentle" group (SMI inclination {$\geq$} -0.01). Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between SMI inclination and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: There were no differences in patient characteristics between the two groups with respect to median age, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), disease control rate or first-line treatment regimen. OS from the start of second-line GD therapy group was significantly shorter in the "steep" group relative to the "gentle" group. The multivariate analysis revealed that "steep" SMI inclination and presence of anemia were strong predictors of poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Higher values of SMI inclination, indicating a faster rate of skeletal muscle mass reduction, may serve as a useful predictive marker for OS in mUC patients undergoing second-line GD chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Treatment of rectal cancer has changed dramatically over the last decade. The worldwide introduction of total mesorectal excision in combination with the increasing use of radio(chemo)-therapy has led to an improved prognosis. One of the main prognostic factors in rectal cancer is the circumferential resection margin (CRM). Since the initial description of its clinical importance in 1986, the involvement of this margin (also called lateral or radial resection margin) has been associated with a poor prognosis. METHODS: In the current review, the evidence for the importance of the CRM in more than 17,500 patients is reviewed, and the relevance of this assessment to modern treatment is assessed. RESULTS: We demonstrate that, after neoadjuvant therapy (both radiotherapy and radiochemotherapy), the predictive value of the CRM for local recurrence is significantly higher than when no preoperative therapy has been applied (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.3 v 2.0, respectively; P {$<$} .05). Furthermore, involvement of the CRM is a powerful predictor of both development of distant metastases (HR = 2.8; 95\% CI, 1.9 to 4.3) and survival (HR = 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 2.3). In addition to the prognostic data, this review describes different modes of margin involvement, exact definitions, and factors influencing its presence. CONCLUSION: CRM involvement is one of the key factors in rectal cancer treatment.},

This study aimed to confirm that postoperative skeletal muscle decrease influences long-term patient outcomes. METHODS: Data were collected from 218 patients who underwent curative esophagectomy for esophageal cancer whose data were available before and 6~months after surgery. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was measured at the level of the L3 vertebrae, and the postoperative change in the SMI compared with preoperative values was calculated as the delta SMI. RESULTS: The mean SMI value was -\,11.64\%, and the median delta SMI value was -\,11.88\%. The first and third quartiles were defined as cutoffs, and 218 patients were classified as the mild-loss group (54 patients), moderate-loss group (110 patients), and severe-loss group (54 patients). The patients with a more severely reduced SMI had a worse prognosis (5-year overall survival rates: mild loss, 66.6\%; moderate loss, 58.8\%; and severe loss, 48.5\%; p\,=\,0.0314). This correlation between reduced SMI and prognosis also was observed for the patients with preoperative sarcopenia (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), but not for those without preoperative sarcopenia.

  abstract = {Background Esophagogastric anastomosis after esophagectomy has been performed with a variety of techniques during the past decade. However, anastomotic leakage and stricture are still important clinical problems after esophagogastric anastomosis, causing burdensome symptoms and poor quality of life. Herein, we describe a novel cervical end-to-side triangulating esophagogastric anastomoasis using linear stapler. Methods A total of 90 patients (85 \% male; mean age 63 years) with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent cervical end-to-side esophagogastric triangular anastomosis using a linear stapler after minimally invasive esophagectomy between November 2006 and April 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Results The median operation time was 602 min (range 424\textendash 936 min). The volume of blood loss during the entire operative procedure was 127 ml (range 0\textendash 700 ml). There were no cases of anastomotic leakage in this study, although four patients (4.4 \%) developed dysphagia associated with benign anastomotic stricture formation. All patients with a benign anastomotic stricture underwent balloon dilation, which resulted in improvement in their symptoms. Conclusions Considering the absence of anastomotic leakage and low rate of anastomotic stricture formation in this study, our modified triangular esophagogastric anastomosis technique appears promising and may contribute to reduced morbidity and mortality rates following esophagectomy.},

Moreover, there are few reports about nomograms in inoperable locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer (AGC), although several studies have been reported regarding other cancer types. This retrospective study aimed to develop nomograms that combine HER2 status and other prognostic factors to predict the survival outcomes of AGC patients starting first-line treatment. Methods In this study, 838 consecutive AGC patients starting first-line chemotherapy at the Aichi Cancer Center Hospital (ACC) were included to establish the nomograms that calculated the predicted probability of survival at different time points, 6 months and 1 and 2 years for overall survival (OS) and 3 and 6 months, and 1 year for progression free survival (PFS). Nomograms were independently validated with 269 consecutive AGC patients at the Cancer Center Hospital (SCC) who underwent first-line chemotherapy. The discriminatory ability and accuracy of the models were assessed using Harrell's c-index. IHC3+ or IHC2+/ISH+ tumors were defined as HER2 positive. Results At a median follow-up of 12.3 (ACC) and 11.6 (SCC) months, the median OS was 12.5 and 12.4 months (P=1.00), and the median PFS was 4.8 and 5.8 months (P=0.03), respectively. The nomograms showed good C-index values: OS was respectively 0.688 and 0.576 and PFS was respectively for 0.643 and 0.544. Conclusions The nomograms including HER2 status as covariate are crucial determinants of clinical care.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: While obesity is considered a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer (CRC), there is increasing evidence that not simply body mass index (BMI) alone but specifically abdominal fat distribution is what matters. As part of the ColoCare study, this study measured the distribution of adipose tissue compartments in CRC patients and aimed to identify the body metric that best correlates with these measurements as a useful proxy for adipose tissue distribution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 120 newly-diagnosed CRC patients who underwent multidetector computed tomography (CT), densitometric quantification of total (TFA), visceral (VFA), intraperitoneal (IFA), retroperitoneal (RFA), and subcutaneous fat area (SFA), as well as the M. erector spinae and psoas was performed to test the association with gender, age, tumor stage, metabolic equivalents, BMI, waist-to-height (WHtR) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). RESULTS: VFA was 28.8 \% higher in men (pVFA{$<$}0.0001) and 30.5 \% higher in patients older than 61 years (pVFA{$<$}0.0001). WHtR correlated best with all adipose tissue compartments (rVFA=0.69, rTFA=0.84, p{$<$}0.0001) and visceral-to-subcutaneous-fat-ratio (VFR, rVFR=0.22, p={$<$}0.05). Patients with tumor stages III/IV showed significantly lower overall adipose tissue than I/II. Increased M. erector spinae mass was inversely correlated with all compartments. CONCLUSION: Densitometric quantification on CT is a highly reproducible and reliable method to show fat distribution across adipose tissue compartments. This distribution might be best reflected by WHtR, rather than by BMI or WHR. KEY POINTS: \textbullet{} Densitometric quantification of adipose tissue on CT is highly reproducible and reliable. \textbullet{} Waist-to-height ratio better correlates with adipose tissue compartments and VFR than BMI or waist-to-hip ratio. \textbullet{} Men have higher a higher visceral fat area than women. \textbullet{} Patients older than 61 years have higher visceral fat area. \textbullet{} Patients with tumor stages III/IV have significantly lower adipose tissue than those in stages I/II.},

  abstract = {Background. Although muscle strength and mass are highly correlated, the relationship between direct measures of low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and strength in association with mortality has not been examined. Methods. Total mortality rates were examined in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study in 2292 participants (aged 70\textendash 79 years, 51.6\% women, and 38.8\% black). Knee extension strength was measured with isokinetic dynamometry, grip strength with isometric dynamometry. Thigh muscle area was measured by computed tomography (CT) scan, and leg and arm lean soft tissue mass were determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Both strength and muscle size were assessed as in gender-specific Cox proportional hazards models, with age, race, comorbidities, smoking status, level of physical activity, fat area by CT or fat mass by DXA, height, and markers of inflammation, including interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-a considered as potential confounders. Results. There were 286 deaths over an average of 4.9 (standard deviation {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.9) years of follow-up. Both quadriceps and grip strength were strongly related to mortality. For quadriceps strength (per standard deviation of 38 Nm), the crude hazard ratio for men was 1.51 (95\% confidence interval, 1.28\textendash 1.79) and 1.65 (95\% confidence interval, 1.19\textendash 2.30) for women. Muscle size, determined by either CT area or DXA regional lean mass, was not strongly related to mortality. In the models of quadriceps strength and mortality, adjustment for muscle area or regional lean mass only slightly attenuated the associations. Further adjustment for other factors also had minimal effect on the association of quadriceps strength with mortality. Associations of grip strength with mortality were similar. Conclusion. Low muscle mass did not explain the strong association of strength with mortality, demonstrating that muscle strength as a marker of muscle quality is more important than quantity in estimating mortality risk. Grip strength provided risk estimates similar to those of quadriceps strength.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The CLASSIC trial was done to compare adjuvant capecitabine plus oxaliplatin versus observation after D2 gastrectomy for patients with stage II or III gastric cancer. The planned interim analysis of CLASSIC (median follow-up 34 months) showed that adjuvant capecitabine plus oxaliplatin significantly improved disease-free survival, the primary endpoint, compared with observation after D2 gastrectomy. We report the 5-year follow-up data from the trial. METHODS: CLASSIC was a phase 3, randomised, open-label study done at 35 cancer centres, medical centres, and hospitals in China, South Korea, and Taiwan. Patients with stage II-IIIB gastric cancer who underwent curative D2 gastrectomy were randomly assigned (1:1) after surgery to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (eight 3-week cycles of oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-14 plus intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) on day 1) for 6 months or observation alone. Randomisation was stratified by country and disease stage with a permuted block (size four) design. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was 3-year disease-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This analysis presents the final preplanned assessment of outcomes after 5 years. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00411229. FINDINGS: We enrolled 1035 patients: 520 were randomly assigned to adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin, and 515 to observation. Median follow-up for this analysis in the intention-to-treat population was 62{$\cdot$}4 months (IQR 54-70). 139 (27\%) patients had disease-free survival events in the adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin group versus 203 (39\%) patients in the observation group (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0{$\cdot$}58, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}47-0{$\cdot$}72; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Estimated 5-year disease-free survival was 68\% (95\% CI 63-73) in the adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin group versus 53\% (47-58) in the observation alone group. By the clinical cutoff date, 103 patients (20\%) had died in the adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin group versus 141 patients (27\%) in the observation group (stratified HR 0{$\cdot$}66, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}51-0{$\cdot$}85; p=0{$\cdot$}0015). Estimated 5-year overall survival was 78\% (95\% CI 74-82) in the adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin group versus 69\% (64-73) in the observation group. Adverse event data were not collected after the primary analysis. INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant treatment with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin after D2 gastrectomy should be considered for patients with operable stage II or III gastric cancer.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) plus surgery is a standard treatment for locally advanced oesophageal cancer. With this treatment, 29\% of patients have a pathologically complete response in the resection specimen. This provides the rationale for investigating an active surveillance approach. The aim of this study is to assess the (cost-)effectiveness of active surveillance vs. standard oesophagectomy after nCRT for oesophageal cancer. METHODS: This is a phase-III multi-centre, stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial. A total of 300 patients with clinically complete response (cCR, i.e. no local or disseminated disease proven by histology) after nCRT will be randomised to show non-inferiority of active surveillance to standard oesophagectomy (non-inferiority margin 15\%, intra-correlation coefficient 0.02, power 80\%, 2-sided {$\alpha$} 0.05, 12\% drop-out). Patients will undergo a first clinical response evaluation (CRE-I) 4-6~weeks after nCRT, consisting of endoscopy with bite-on-bite biopsies of the primary tumour site and other suspected lesions. Clinically complete responders will undergo a second CRE (CRE-II), 6-8~weeks after CRE-I. CRE-II will include 18F-FDG-PET-CT, followed by endoscopy with bite-on-bite biopsies and ultra-endosonography plus fine needle aspiration of suspected lymph nodes and/or PET- positive lesions. Patients with cCR at CRE-II will be assigned to oesophagectomy (first phase) or active surveillance (second phase of the study). The duration of the first phase is determined randomly over the 12 centres, i.e., stepped-wedge cluster design. Patients in the active surveillance arm will undergo diagnostic evaluations similar to CRE-II at 6/9/12/16/20/24/30/36/48 and 60~months after nCRT. In this arm, oesophagectomy will be offered only to patients in whom locoregional regrowth is highly suspected or proven, without distant dissemination. The main study parameter is overall survival; secondary endpoints include percentage of patients who do not undergo surgery, quality of life, clinical irresectability (cT4b) rate, radical resection rate, postoperative complications, progression-free survival, distant dissemination rate, and cost-effectiveness. We hypothesise that active surveillance leads to non-inferior survival, improved quality of life and a reduction in costs, compared to standard oesophagectomy. DISCUSSION: If active surveillance and surgery as needed after nCRT leads to non-inferior survival compared to standard oesophagectomy, this organ-sparing approach can be implemented as a standard of care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: After neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for oesophageal cancer, roughly half of the patients with squamous cell carcinoma and a quarter of those with adenocarcinoma have a pathological complete response of the primary tumour before surgery. Thus, the necessity of standard oesophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be reconsidered for patients who respond sufficiently to neoadjuvant treatment. In this study, we aimed to establish the accuracy of detection of residual disease after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with different diagnostic approaches, and the optimal combination of diagnostic techniques for clinical response evaluations. METHODS: The preSANO trial was a prospective, multicentre, diagnostic cohort study at six centres in the Netherlands. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had histologically proven, resectable, squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or oesophagogastric junction, and were eligible for potential curative therapy with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (five weekly cycles of carboplatin [area under the curve 2 mg/mL per min] plus paclitaxel [50 mg/m2 of body-surface area] combined with 41{$\cdot$}4 Gy radiotherapy in 23 fractions) followed by oesophagectomy. 4-6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, patients had oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies and endoscopic ultrasonography with measurement of maximum tumour thickness. Patients with histologically proven locoregional residual disease or no-pass during endoscopy and without distant metastases underwent immediate surgical resection. In the remaining patients a second clinical response evaluation was done (PET-CT, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies, endoscopic ultrasonography with measurement of maximum tumour thickness, and fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes), followed by surgery 12-14 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The primary endpoint was the correlation between clinical response during clinical response evaluations and the final pathological response in resection specimens, as shown by the proportion of tumour regression grade (TRG) 3 or 4 ({$>$}10\% residual carcinoma in the resection specimen) residual tumours that was missed during clinical response evaluations. This study was registered with the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR4834), and has been completed. FINDINGS: Between July 22, 2013, and Dec 28, 2016, 219 patients were included, 207 of whom were included in the analyses. Eight of 26 TRG3 or TRG4 tumours (31\% [95\% CI 17-50]) were missed by endoscopy with regular biopsies and fine-needle aspiration. Four of 41 TRG3 or TRG4 tumours (10\% [95\% CI 4-23]) were missed with bite-on-bite biopsies and fine-needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasonography with maximum tumour thickness measurement missed TRG3 or TRG4 residual tumours in 11 of 39 patients (28\% [95\% CI 17-44]). PET-CT missed six of 41 TRG3 or TRG4 tumours (15\% [95\% CI 7-28]). PET-CT detected interval distant histologically proven metastases in 18 (9\%) of 190 patients (one squamous cell carcinoma, 17 adenocarcinomas). INTERPRETATION: After neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for oesophageal cancer, clinical response evaluation with endoscopic ultrasonography, bite-on-bite biopsies, and fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes was adequate for detection of locoregional residual disease, with PET-CT for detection of interval metastases. Active surveillance with this combination of diagnostic modalities is now being assessed in a phase 3 randomised controlled trial (SANO trial; Netherlands Trial Register NTR6803).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare overall survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma who underwent transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) with limited lymphadenectomy or transthoracic esophagectomy (TTE) with extended lymphadenectomy with or without neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). BACKGROUND: The application of neoadjuvant therapy might change the association between the extent of lymphadenectomy and survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. This may influence the choice of surgical approach in patients treated with nCRT. METHODS: Patients with potentially curable subcarinal esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with surgery alone or nCRT followed by surgery in 7 centers were included. The effect of surgical approach on overall survival, differentiated by the addition or omission of nCRT, was analyzed using a multivariable Cox regression model that included well-known prognostic factors and factors that might have influenced the choice of surgical approach. RESULTS: In total, 701 patients were included, of whom 318 had TTE with extended lymphadenectomy and 383 had THE with limited lymphadenectomy. TTE had differential effects on survival (P for interaction = 0.02), with a more favorable prognostic effect in patients who were treated with surgery alone [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-1.03]. This association was statistically significant in a subgroup of patients with 1 to 8 positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen (HR = 0.62, 95\% CI 0.43-0.90). The favorable prognostic effect of TTE over THE was absent in the nCRT and surgery group (HR = 1.16, 95\% CI 0.80-1.66) and in the subgroup of nCRT patients with 1 to 8 positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen (HR = 1.00, 95\% CI 0.61-1.68). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to surgery alone, the addition of nCRT may reduce the need for TTE with extended lymphadenectomy to improve long-term survival in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To develop a pipeline for automated body composition analysis and skeletal muscle assessment with integrated quality control for large-scale application in opportunistic imaging. METHODS: First, a convolutional neural network for extraction of a single slice at the L3/L4 lumbar level was developed on CT scans of 240 patients applying the nnU-Net framework. Second, a 2D competitive dense fully convolutional U-Net for segmentation of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (VAT, SAT), skeletal muscle (SM), and subsequent determination of fatty muscle fraction (FMF) was developed on single CT slices of 1143 patients. For both steps, automated quality control was integrated by a logistic regression model classifying the presence of L3/L4 and a linear regression model predicting the segmentation quality in terms of Dice score. To evaluate the performance of the entire pipeline end-to-end, body composition metrics, and FMF were compared to manual analyses including 364 patients from two centers. RESULTS: Excellent results were observed for slice extraction (z-deviation\,=\,2.46\,{$\pm$}\,6.20~mm) and segmentation (Dice score for SM\,=\,0.95\,{$\pm$}\,0.04, VAT\,=\,0.98\,{$\pm$}\,0.02, SAT\,=\,0.97\,{$\pm$}\,0.04) on the dual-center test set excluding cases with artifacts due to metallic implants. No data were excluded for end-to-end performance analyses. With a restrictive setting of the integrated segmentation quality control, 39 of 364 patients were excluded containing 8 cases with metallic implants. This setting ensured a high agreement between manual and fully automated analyses with mean relative area deviations of {$\Delta$}SM\,=\,3.3\,{$\pm$}\,4.1\%, {$\Delta$}VAT\,=\,3.0\,{$\pm$}\,4.7\%, {$\Delta$}SAT\,=\,2.7\,{$\pm$}\,4.3\%, and {$\Delta$}FMF\,=\,4.3\,{$\pm$}\,4.4\%. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents an end-to-end automated deep learning pipeline for large-scale opportunistic assessment of body composition metrics and sarcopenia biomarkers in clinical routine. KEY POINTS: \textbullet{} Body composition metrics and skeletal muscle quality can be opportunistically determined from routine abdominal CT scans. \textbullet{} A pipeline consisting of two convolutional neural networks allows an end-to-end automated analysis. \textbullet{} Machine-learning-based quality control ensures high agreement between manual and automatic analysis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoscopic resection (ER) is an important advance in the management of esophageal tumors. It has been used successfully for superficial esophageal cancer and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) arising out of Barrett epithelium. METHODS: From a single institution within the Department of Surgery, patients who underwent ER for esophageal tumors between December 2001 and January 2012 were evaluated. Demographic, clinical, and pathologic variables were collected and reviewed. RESULTS: We identified 81 patients who underwent ER for esophageal lesions. Median patient age was 69 years, and the median follow-up was 3.25 years. In patients with HGD, at the time of last endoscopy, the complete eradication rate of HGD was 84 \% and cancer-specific survival was 100 \%. During surveillance, one patient developed an invasive carcinoma that required endoscopic therapy. Patients with T1a and negative deep margins on ER had a recurrence-free and cancer-specific survival of 100 \%. There were seven patients with T1b and negative margins on ER. Three patients underwent esophagectomy; final pathology revealed no residual malignancy or lymph node metastasis. Two patients had definitive chemoradiation, and two patients were observed. To date, there has been no cancer recurrence. In all patients who underwent ER, there was one episode of bleeding that required endoscopic treatment and admission for observation. CONCLUSIONS: ER can be performed safely and can adequately stage and often treat patients with HGD and superficial cancers. Patients with HGD and T1a disease with negative margins are cured with ER alone. Observation and surveillance may be an option for select patients with low-risk, early submucosal disease (T1b) and negative margins.},

Using the National Cancer Database, we investigated racial disparities in treatment and outcome of esophageal cancer patients. The National Cancer Database was queried from 2004 to 2017. Logistic regression and survival analysis were used to determine racial differences in access, treatment and outcome. A total of 127,098 patients were included. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95\% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery).There are racial disparities in the treatment of esophageal cancer. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians have improved overall survival versus Caucasians. African Americans have the worst overall survival. Racial disparities likely affect outcome in esophageal cancer. But other factors, such as epigenetics and tumor biology, may correlate more strongly with outcome for patients with esophageal cancer.},

The impact of muscle quality on outcomes, however, is unclear. This retrospective study investigated the impact of preoperative skeletal muscle quantity and quality on survival in patients undergoing resection of pancreatic cancer. Methods. We investigated 230 patients who underwent resection of pancreatic cancer between 2004 and 2013. The quantity and quality of skeletal muscle, indicated by psoas muscle mass index (PMI) and intramuscular adipose tissue content (IMAC), were measured in preoperative computed tomography images. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were compared according to PMI and IMAC, and prognostic factors after pancreatic resection were assessed. Results. The OS and RFS rates in patients with low PMI were lesser than in those with normal/high PMI (P {$<$} .001, P {$<$} .001), with a mean survival time of 17.7 and 33.2 months, respectively. The OS and RFS rates in patients with high IMAC also were less than in those with normal/low IMAC (P {$<$} .001, P = .003) (mean survival time = 21.5 and 56.5 months, respectively).

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether extended transthoracic esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma of the mid/distal esophagus improves long-term survival. BACKGROUND: A randomized trial was performed to compare surgical techniques. Complete 5-year survival data are now available. METHODS: A total of 220 patients with adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus (type I) or gastric cardia involving the distal esophagus (type II) were randomly assigned to limited transhiatal esophagectomy or to extended transthoracic esophagectomy with en bloc lymphadenectomy. Patients with peroperatively irresectable/incurable cancer were excluded from this analysis (n = 15). A total of 95 patients underwent transhiatal esophagectomy and 110 patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy. RESULTS: After transhiatal and transthoracic resection, 5-year survival was 34\% and 36\%, respectively (P = 0.71, per protocol analysis). In a subgroup analysis, based on the location of the primary tumor according to the resection specimen, no overall survival benefit for either surgical approach was seen in 115 patients with a type II tumor (P = 0.81). In 90 patients with a type I tumor, a survival benefit of 14\% was seen with the transthoracic approach (51\% vs. 37\%, P = 0.33). There was evidence that the treatment effect differed depending on the number of positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen (test for interaction P = 0.06). In patients (n = 55) without positive nodes locoregional disease-free survival after transhiatal esophagectomy was comparable to that after transthoracic esophagectomy (86\% and 89\%, respectively). The same was true for patients (n = 46) with more than 8 positive nodes (0\% in both groups). Patients (n = 104) with 1 to 8 positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen showed a 5-year locoregional disease-free survival advantage if operated via the transthoracic route (23\% vs. 64\%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: There is no significant overall survival benefit for either approach. However, compared with limited transhiatal resection extended transthoracic esophagectomy for type I esophageal adenocarcinoma shows an ongoing trend towards better 5-year survival. Moreover, patients with a limited number of positive lymph nodes in the resection specimen seem to benefit from an extended transthoracic esophagectomy.},

However, multivariate analysis identified sarcopenic obesity as the only independent predictor of prognosis in elderly patients. Sarcopenic obesity was associated with higher body mass index (p = 0.04), better SGA (p {$<$} 0.01), and lower pre-treatment weight loss (p = 0.03). NAC was as effective and safe for elderly patients without sarcopenic obesity as for young patients.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze recurrence patterns in patients with cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with either preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) plus surgery or surgery alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Recurrence pattern was analyzed in patients from the previously published CROSS I and II trials in relation to radiation target volumes. CRT consisted of five weekly courses of paclitaxel and carboplatin combined with a concurrent radiation dose of 41.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions to the tumor and pathologic lymph nodes with margin. RESULTS: Of the 422 patients included from 2001 to 2008, 418 were available for analysis. Histology was mostly adenocarcinoma (75\%). Of the 374 patients who underwent resection, 86\% were allocated to surgery and 92\% to CRT plus surgery. On January 1, 2011, after a minimum follow-up of 24 months (median, 45 months), the overall recurrence rate in the surgery arm was 58\% versus 35\% in the CRT plus surgery arm. Preoperative CRT reduced locoregional recurrence (LRR) from 34\% to 14\% (P {$<$} .001) and peritoneal carcinomatosis from 14\% to 4\% (P {$<$} .001). There was a small but significant effect on hematogenous dissemination in favor of the CRT group (35\% v 29\%; P = .025). LRR occurred in 5\% within the target volume, in 2\% in the margins, and in 6\% outside the radiation target volume. In 1\%, the exact site in relation to the target volume was unclear. Only 1\% had an isolated infield recurrence after CRT plus surgery. CONCLUSION: Preoperative CRT in patients with esophageal cancer reduced LRR and peritoneal carcinomatosis. Recurrence within the radiation target volume occurred in only 5\%, mostly combined with outfield failures.},

The objective of this study was to review the authors' 30-year experience with THE and changing trends in its use. METHODS: Using the authors' prospective Esophagectomy Database, this single institution experience with THE was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Two thousand and seven THEs were performed-1063 (previously reported) between 1976 and 1998 (group I) and 944 from 1998 to 2006 (group II), 24\% for benign disease, 76\%, cancer. THE was possible in 98\%. Stomach was the esophageal substitute in 97\%. Comparing outcomes between group I and group II, statistically significant differences (P {$<$} 0.001) were observed in hospital mortality (4\% vs. 1\%); adenocarcinoma histology (69\% vs. 86\%); use of neoadjuvant chemoradiation (28\% vs. 52\%); mean blood loss (677 vs. 368 mL); anastomotic leak (14\% vs. 9\%); and discharge within 10 days (52\% vs. 78\%). Major complications remain infrequent: wound infection/dehiscence, 3\%, atelectasis/pneumonia, 2\%, intrathoracic hemorrhage, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, chylothorax, and tracheal laceration, {$<$}1\% each. Late functional results have been good or excellent in 73\%. Aggressive preoperative conditioning, avoiding the ICU, improved pain management, and early ambulation reduce length of stay, with 50\% in group II discharged within 1 week. CONCLUSION: THE refinements have reduced the historic morbidity and mortality of esophageal resection. This largest reported THE experience reinforces the value of consistent technique and a clinical pathway in managing these high acuity esophageal patients.},

Continuity of the alimentary tract was restored by anastomosing the pharynx or cervical esophagus either to stomach (19 patients) or to a colonic graft (seven patients). Esophageal resection and reconstruction were performed in a single stage in 25 patients, and the esophageal substitute was positioned in the posterior mediastinum in the original esophageal bed in 24 patients. There were no deaths directly related to the technique of blunt esophagectomy. Average intraoperative blood loss was 1,350 ml. for the entire group, 1,650 ml. for those requiring concomitant laryngectomy and 1,050 ml. for those undergoing esophagectomy without laryngectomy. Complications in these patients included pneumothorax (eight), transient hoarseness (five), pleural effusion (five), anastomotic leak (four), subphrenic abscess (one), and cerebrovascular accident (one). The five deaths were due to pheumonia (two), innominate artery rupture (two), and pulmonary embolus (one).

This study aims to investigate body mass index (BMI) kinetics and the risk factors of malnutrition among 1-year disease-free survivors after radical transthoracic oesophagectomy for cancer. METHODS: From a prospective single-institution database, 118 1-year disease-free survivors having undergone a R0 transthoracic oesophagectomy with gastric tubulization between 2000 and 2008 were identified retrospectively. BMI values were collected at the onset of the disease (pre-treatment BMI), at the time of surgery (preoperative BMI), at postoperative 6 months and 1 year after oesophagectomy (1-year BMI). Logistic regression was performed with adjustment for confounders to estimate odds ratios of the factors associated with a 1-year weight loss (WL) of at least 15\% of the pre-treatment body weight (BW). RESULTS: At the onset of the disease, 5 patients (4\%) were underweighted (BMI {$<$} 8.5 kg/m\&sup2;), 65 (55\%) were normal (BMI = 18.5-24.9 kg/m\&sup2;), 36 (31\%) were overweighted (BMI {$>$} 25 kg/m\&sup2;) and 12 (10\%) were obese (BMI {$>$} 30 kg/m\&sup2;). Mean pre-treatment, preoperative, postoperative 6-month and 1-year BMI values were 24.64 {$\pm$} 4 kg/m\&sup2;, 23.55 {$\pm$} 3.8 kg/m\&sup2;, 21.7 {$\pm$} 3 kg/m\&sup2; and 21.97 {$\pm$} 4 kg/m\&sup2;, respectively. One-year WL {$\geq$} 15\% of the pre-treatment BW was present in 29 patients (25\%): 18 among the 48 patients (37\%) with a pre-treatment BMI {$\geq$} 25 and 11 among the 70 patients (15\%) with pre-treatment BMI {$<$} 25 (P = 0.006). On logistic regression, initial overweighting was the sole independent prognosticator of 1-year postoperative WL of at least 15\% of the pre-treatment BW (P = 0.039; OR: 2.96, [1.06-8.32]). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative malnutrition remains a severe problem after oesophageal cancer resection, even in long-term disease-free survivors. Overweight and obese patients are the segment population most exposed to this postoperative malnutrition, suggesting that such surgery could have substantial bariatric effect. A special vigilance programme on the nutritional status of this sub-group of patients should be the rule.},

Methods: all consecutive older outpatients with cancer were included in a prospective two-centre cohort study between 2013 and 2017 and had geriatric assessment. We used the frailty phenotype. Sarcopenia and cachexia were built as latent variables by including observed variables related to physical performances and related to nutrition and inflammation respectively. Structural equation modelling was used to distinguish between direct and indirect effects of the frailty parameters on the risk of death (Model 1) and the risk of morbidity (defined by unplanned hospitalization and/or disability and/or a fall; Model 2). The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and the comparative fit index (CFI) were used to assess the model fit. Results: 603 older outpatients were included (mean age: 81.2 {$\pm$} 6.1; women: 54\%; frailty phenotype: 58\%). The 6-month mortality and morbidity rates were 18\% and 64\%, respectively.

Statistical significance was defined as P {$\leq$} .05. RESULTS: Approximately 88.4\% of our patients were White and 11.6\% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9\% v 31.8\%, respectively; P {$<$} .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment. CONCLUSION: Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes.},

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 181 patients who underwent esophagectomy and gastric pull-up from 2012 to June 2016. Patients with operative mortality and recurrences were excluded. Percent change in body weight was defined as change in body weight (\%)\,=\,(1-year body weight\,-\,preoperative body weight)\,\texttimes\,100/preoperative body weight. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 62.98\,{$\pm$}\,8.23~years with 164 men (90.6\%). Mean preoperative body weight was 63.12\,{$\pm$}\,9.42~kg, and body weight at 1~year was 56.04\,{$\pm$}\,8.59~kg. Mean change in body weight was -\,10.95\,{$\pm$}\,7.50\%, and 98 (54.1\%) patients showed weight loss more than 10\% compared to initial body weight. Univariable analysis showed that initial body weight, narrow gastric tube, thoracotomy, laparotomy, and postoperative vocal cord palsy (VCP) were related to more than 10\% weight loss. Multivariable analysis showed that initial body weight (odds ratio [OR]\,=\,1.041, p\,=\,0.031) and postoperative VCP (OR\,=\,2.772, p\,=\,0.025) were adverse risk factors for weight loss 1~year after esophagectomy, whereas conduit type, route of reconstruction, postoperative complications, anastomotic complications, minimally invasive esophagectomy, and adjuvant therapy were not. CONCLUSIONS: Initial body weight and postoperative VCP were related to weight loss. Patients with VCP need additional nutritional monitoring and support.},

  abstract = {Cancer causes muscle mass loss, which is associated with a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy may also reduce muscle mass. We investigated skeletal muscle mass change during palliative chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) and its association with treatment outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed 111 consecutive AGC patients who underwent first-line palliative chemotherapy. Skeletal muscle area was measured before and after chemotherapy at the third lumbar vertebra level using computed tomography scans. We compared skeletal muscle index (SMI), body mass index (BMI), and body weight changes to chemotherapy response and survival. The 80 male and 31 female patients' median age was 65 (range 31-87) years, and 46.8\% had sarcopenia at baseline. Median pre-chemotherapy to post-chemotherapy SMI, BMI, and body weight decreases were -\,4.5~cm2/m2 (-\,11.3\%) (P\,{$<$}\,0.001); -\,0.7~kg/m2 (-\,3.2\%) (P\,{$<$}\,0.001); and -\,2.0~kg (-\,3.5\%) (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), respectively. Median SMI decreases for patients with objective response, stable disease, and disease progression were -\,4.0 cm2/m2 (range -\,20.1\,\textasciitilde\,9.5); -\,4.5 cm2/m2 (range -\,19.8\,\textasciitilde\,0.8); and -\,3.8 cm2/m2 (range: -\,17.6\,\textasciitilde\,0.1), respectively. Response to chemotherapy was not associated with SMI decrease (P\,=\,0.463). In multivariable analysis, sarcopenia at baseline (HR 1.681; 95\% CI 1.083-2.609, P\,=\,0.021), decreased SMI (HR 1.620; 95\% CI 1.041-2.520; P\,=\,0.032) were significant poor prognostic factors for survival. Skeletal muscle mass decreased significantly during chemotherapy in AGC patients, but was not associated with chemotherapy response. Decreased SMI was a poor prognostic factor in AGC patients during first-line palliative chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This network meta-analysis compared overall survival after neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), radiotherapy (RT), or combinations of both (chemoradiotherapy, CRT) or surgery alone to identify the most effective approach. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The optimal treatment for resectable esophageal cancer is unknown. METHODS: A search for randomized controlled trials reporting on neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies was conducted. Using a network meta-analysis, treatments were ranked based on their effectiveness for improving survival. RESULTS: In 33 eligible randomized controlled trials, 6072 patients were randomized to receive either surgery alone (N = 2459) or neoadjuvant CT (N = 1332), RT (N = 58), and CRT (N = 1196) followed by surgery or surgery followed by adjuvant CT (N = 542), RT (N = 383), and CRT (N = 102). Twenty-one comparisons were generated. Neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery compared with surgery alone was the only treatment to significantly improve survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-0.87]. When trials were grouped considering neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies and surgery alone, neoadjuvant therapies combined with surgery compared with surgery alone showed a survival advantage (HR = 0.83, 95\% CI 0.76-0.90), whereas surgery along with adjuvant therapies showed no significant survival advantage (HR = 0.87, 95\% CI 0.67-1.14). A subgroup analysis of neoadjuvant therapies showed a superior effectiveness of neoadjuvant CRT and surgery compared with surgery alone (HR = 0.77, 95\% CI 0.68-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis showed neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery to be the most effective strategy in improving survival of resectable esophageal cancer. Resources should be focused on developing the most effective neoadjuvant CRT regimens for both adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our institution's experience with low anterior resection in combination with coloanal anastomosis (LAR/CAA) for primary rectal cancer was reviewed (1) to determine cancer treatment results, 2) to identify risk factors for pelvic recurrence, and 3) to assess the long-term success of sphincter preservation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Use of sphincter-preserving resection for mid-rectal and selected distal-rectal cancers continues to increase. As surgical techniques and adjuvant therapy evolve, treatment results must be carefully assessed. METHODS: One hundred thirty-four patients treated for primary rectal cancer by LAR/CAA between 1977 and 1990 were studied retrospectively. All pathologic slides were reviewed. Median follow-up was 4 years. RESULTS: Actuarial 5-year survival for all patients was 73\%. Among 36 patients who relapsed, distant metastatic disease had developed at the time of first clinical relapse in most (86\%). Pelvic recurrence was detected in 13 patients, an actuarial rate of 11\% at 5 years. Mesenteric implants, positive microscopic resection margin, T3 tumor, perineural invasion, blood vessel invasion, and high tumor grade were associated with increased risk for pelvic recurrence. Eleven patients ultimately required permanent colostomy, and in eight instances the cause was pelvic recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Low anterior resection combined with coloanal anastomosis provides good treatment for mid-rectal cancers and for some distal rectal cancers. Pelvic recurrence is not associated with short distal resection margins but is correlated with the presence of histopathologic markers of aggressive disease in the primary tumor. Long-term preservation of anal sphincter function depends primarily on control of pelvic tumor and can be achieved in more than 90\% of patients.},

This report provides 5 year follow-up data from a large prospective study investigating the efficacy and safety of endoscopic treatment in these patients and analysing risk factors for recurrence. DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: Academic tertiary care centre. PATIENTS: Between October 1996 and September 2002, 61 patients with HGIN and 288 with BC were included (173 with short-segment and 176 with long-segment Barrett's oesophagus) from a total of 486 patients presenting with Barrett's neoplasia. Patients with submucosal or more advanced cancer were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Endoscopic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of complete remission and recurrence rate, tumour-associated death. RESULTS: Endoscopic resection was performed in 279 patients, photodynamic therapy in 55, and both procedures in 13; two patients received argon plasma coagulation. The mean follow-up period was 63.6 (SD 23.1) months. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 337 patients (96.6\%); surgery was necessary in 13 (3.7\%) after endoscopic therapy failed. Metachronous lesions developed during the follow-up in 74 patients (21.5\%); 56 died of concomitant disease, but none died of BC. The calculated 5 year survival rate was 84\%. The risk factors most frequently associated with recurrence were piecemeal resection, long-segment Barrett's oesophagus, no ablative therapy of Barrett's oesophagus after CR, time until CR achieved {$>$}10 months and multifocal neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that endoscopic therapy was highly effective and safe, with an excellent long-term survival rate. The risk factors identified may help stratify patients who are at risk for recurrence and those requiring more intensified follow-up.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Barrett's esophagus-associated high-grade dysplasia is commonly treated by endoscopy. However, most guidelines offer no recommendations for endoscopic treatment of mucosal adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (mAC). We investigated the efficacy and safety of endoscopic resection in a large series of patients with mAC. METHODS: We collected data from 1000 consecutive patients (mean age, 69.1 {$\pm$} 10.7 years; 861 men) with mAC (481 with short-segment and 519 with long-segment Barrett's esophagus) who presented at a tertiary care center from October 1996 to September 2010. Patients with low-grade and high-grade dysplasia and submucosal or more advanced cancer were excluded. All patients underwent endoscopic resection of mACs. Patients found to have submucosal cancer at their first endoscopy examination were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period of 56.6 {$\pm$} 33.4 months, 963 patients (96.3\%) had achieved a complete response; surgery was necessary in 12 patients (3.7\%) after endoscopic therapy failed. Metachronous lesions or recurrence of cancer developed during the follow-up period in 140 patients (14.5\%) but endoscopic re-treatment was successful in 115, resulting in a long-term complete remission rate of 93.8\%; 111 died of concomitant disease and 2 of Barrett's esophagus-associated cancer. The calculated 10-year survival rate of patients who underwent endoscopic resection of mACs was 75\%. Major complications developed in 15 patients (1.5\%) but could be managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic therapy is highly effective and safe for patients with mAC, with excellent long-term results. In an almost 5-year follow-up of 1000 patients treated with endoscopic resection, there was no mortality and less than 2\% had major complications. Endoscopic therapy should become the standard of care for patients with mAC.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A short course of radiotherapy is commonly prescribed for palliative relief of malignant dysphagia in patients with incurable oesophageal cancer. We compared chemoradiotherapy with radiotherapy alone for dysphagia relief in the palliative setting. METHODS: This multicentre randomised controlled trial included patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal cancer who were randomly assigned (1:1) through a computer-generated adaptive biased coin design to either palliative chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for treatment of malignant dysphagia at 22 hospitals in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the UK. Eligible patients had biopsy-proven oesophageal cancer that was unsuitable for curative treatment, symptomatic dysphagia, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and adequate haematological and renal function. Patients were stratified by hospital, dysphagia score (Mellow scale 1-4), and presence of metastases. The radiotherapy dose was 35 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks for patients in Australia and New Zealand and 30 Gy in ten fractions over 2 weeks for patients in Canada and the UK. Chemotherapy consisted of one cycle of intravenous cisplatin (either 80 mg/m2 on day 1 or 20 mg/m2 per day on days 1-4 of radiotherapy at clinician's discretion) and intravenous fluorouracil 800 mg/m2 per day on days 1-4 of radiotherapy in week 1. Patients were assessed weekly during treatment. The primary endpoint was dysphagia relief (defined as {$\geq$}1 point reduction on the Mellow scale at 9 weeks and maintained 4 weeks later), and key secondary endpoints were dysphagia progression-free survival (defined as a worsening of at least 1 point on the Mellow scale from baseline or best response) and overall survival. These endpoints were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00193882. This trial is closed. FINDINGS: Between July 7, 2003, and March 21, 2012, 111 patients were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy and 109 patients to radiotherapy. One patient in the chemoradiotherapy group was omitted from analysis because of ineligibility. 50 (45\%, 95\% CI 36-55) patients in the chemoradiotherapy group and 38 (35\%, 26-44) in the radiotherapy group obtained dysphagia relief (difference 10{$\cdot$}6\%, 95\% CI -2 to 23; p=0{$\cdot$}13). Median dysphagia progression-free survival was 4{$\cdot$}1 months (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}5-4{$\cdot$}8) versus 3{$\cdot$}4 months (3{$\cdot$}1-4{$\cdot$}3) in the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups, respectively (p=0{$\cdot$}58), and median overall survival was 6{$\cdot$}9 months (95\% CI 5{$\cdot$}1-8{$\cdot$}3) versus 6{$\cdot$}7 months (4{$\cdot$}9-8{$\cdot$}0), respectively (p=0{$\cdot$}88). Of the 211 patients who commenced radiotherapy, grade 3-4 acute toxicity occurred in 38 (36\%) patients in the chemoradiotherapy group and in 17 (16\%) patients in the radiotherapy group (p=0{$\cdot$}0017). Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, oesophagitis, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and mucositis were significantly worse in patients who had chemoradiotherapy than in patients who had radiotherapy. INTERPRETATION: Palliative chemoradiotherapy showed a modest, but not statistically significant, increase in dysphagia relief compared with radiotherapy alone, with minimal improvement in dysphagia progression-free survival and overall survival with chemoradiotherapy but at a cost of increased toxicity. A short course of radiotherapy alone should be considered a safe and well tolerated treatment for malignant dysphagia in the palliative setting.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The progressive loss of skeletal muscle and function (known as sarcopenia) has been shown to be associated with various adverse outcome measures. Sophisticated measurements of body composition are increasingly being incorporated into research studies to stratify patients into those with or without sarcopenia, monitor treatment effects, and predict complications. A typical approach is to select axial image(s) at the mid-lumbar level and use semi-automated software to identify and quantify the skeletal muscle area. This area is then used to estimate whole-body parameters. This approach is somewhat subjective, and in this study we investigate its reproducibility, both within and between observers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Repeated muscle measurements were performed on a cohort of 29 patients by 3 radiologists, to examine their intra- and interobserver reproducibility. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Mean muscle area for the cohort was 156\,cm2, with a wide range (98 - 261\,cm2). There was good intraobserver agreement between measurements, with a mean absolute difference between repeated measurements on the same patient of 0.98\,cm2, and a measurement variability of 2.92\,cm2. Much of the variability was shown to be due to the choice of a different slice when performing the repeated measurement. Averaging two slices provided a small but non-significant improvement in comparison to the single slice approach. Interobserver results showed good agreement, though there was a small bias for one observer, who measured slightly larger volumes compared to the other two. We conclude that the approach described provides reproducible skeletal muscle area measurements, and offer three specific recommendations to minimise variability.},

This preplanned interim analysis examined the pathological outcome of delaying surgery. METHODS: Patients randomized to the SRT and SRT-delay arms in the Stockholm III Trial between October 1998 and November 2010 were included, and data were collected in a prospective register. Additional data regarding tumour regression grade, according to Dworak, and circumferential margin were obtained by reassessment of histopathological slides. RESULTS: A total of 462 of 545 randomized patients had specimens available for reassessment. Patients randomized to SRT-delay had earlier ypT categories, and a higher rate of pathological complete responses (11{$\cdot$}8 versus 1{$\cdot$}7 per cent; P\,=\,0{$\cdot$}001) and Dworak grade 4 tumour regression (10{$\cdot$}1 versus 1{$\cdot$}7 per cent; P\,{$<$}\,0{$\cdot$}001) than patients randomized to SRT without delay. Positive circumferential resection margins were uncommon (6{$\cdot$}3 per cent) and rates did not differ between the two treatment arms. CONCLUSION: Short-course RT induces tumour downstaging if surgery is performed after an interval of 4-8 weeks.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Barrett esophagus containing low-grade dysplasia is associated with an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, a cancer with a rapidly increasing incidence in the western world. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether endoscopic radiofrequency ablation could decrease the rate of neoplastic progression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter randomized clinical trial that enrolled 136 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Barrett esophagus containing low-grade dysplasia at 9 European sites between June 2007 and June 2011. Patient follow-up ended May 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either endoscopic treatment with radiofrequency ablation (ablation) or endoscopic surveillance (control). Ablation was performed with the balloon device for circumferential ablation of the esophagus or the focal device for targeted ablation, with a maximum of 5 sessions allowed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was neoplastic progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma during a 3-year follow-up since randomization. Secondary outcomes were complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and adverse events. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive ablation and 68 to receive control. Ablation reduced the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma by 25.0\% (1.5\% for ablation vs 26.5\% for control; 95\% CI, 14.1\%-35.9\%; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and the risk of progression to adenocarcinoma by 7.4\% (1.5\% for ablation vs 8.8\% for control; 95\% CI, 0\%-14.7\%; P\,=\,.03). Among patients in the ablation group, complete eradication occurred in 92.6\% for dysplasia and 88.2\% for intestinal metaplasia compared with 27.9\% for dysplasia and 0.0\% for intestinal metaplasia among patients in the control group (P\,{$<$}\,.001). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19.1\% of patients receiving ablation (P\,{$<$}\,.001). The most common adverse event was stricture, occurring in 8 patients receiving ablation (11.8\%), all resolved by endoscopic dilation (median, 1 session). The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the trial due to superiority of ablation for the primary outcome and the potential for patient safety issues if the trial continued. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized trial of patients with Barrett esophagus and a confirmed diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia, radiofrequency ablation resulted in a reduced risk of neoplastic progression over 3 years of follow-up.

These multi-modal protocols have been also introduced to oesophageal cancer surgery. This review aimed to evaluate current literature on ERAS in oesophageal cancer surgery and conduct a meta-analysis on primary and secondary outcomes. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library were searched for eligible studies. We analyzed data up to May 2016. Eligible studies had to contain four described ERAS protocol elements. The primary outcome was overall morbidity. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, specific complications, mortality and readmissions. Random effect meta-analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Initial search yielded 1,064 articles. Thorough evaluation resulted in 13 eligible articles which were analyzed. A total of 2,042 patients were included in the analysis (1,058 ERAS group and 984 treated with traditional protocols). Analysis of overall morbidity as well as complication rate did not show any significant reduction. Non-surgical complications and pulmonary complications were significantly lower in the ERAS group, RR = 0.71 95\% CI 0.62-0.80, p {$<$} 0.00001 and RR = 0.75, 95\% CI 0.60-0.94, p = 0.01, respectively. Meta-analysis on length of stay presented significant reduction Mean difference = -3.55, 95\% CI -4.41 to -2.69, p for effect{$<$}0.00001. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review with a meta-analysis on ERAS in oesophageal surgery indicates a reduction of non-surgical complications and no negative influence on overall morbidity. Moreover, a reduction in the length of hospital stay was presented.},

Body composition has been recently linked to patient survival and the onset/recurrence of several types of cancers in numerous cancer research studies. This paper introduces a fully automatic framework for the segmentation of muscle and fat tissues from CT images to estimate body composition. We developed a novel finite element method (FEM) deformable model that incorporates a priori shape information via a statistical deformation model (SDM) within the template-based segmentation framework. The proposed method was validated on 1000 abdominal and 530 thoracic CT images and we obtained very good segmentation results with Jaccard scores in excess of 90\% for both the muscle and fat regions.},

  abstract = {Metabolic reprogramming occurs in tumors to foster cancer cell proliferation, survival and metastasis, but as well at a systemic level affecting the whole organism, eventually leading to cancer cachexia. Indeed, as cancer cells rely on external sources of nitrogen and carbon skeleton to grow, systemic metabolic deregulation promoting tissue wasting and metabolites mobilization ultimately supports tumor growth. Cachectic patients experience a wide range of symptoms affecting several organ functions such as muscle, liver, brain, immune system and heart, collectively decreasing patients' quality of life and worsening their prognosis. Moreover, cachexia is estimated to be the direct cause of at least 20\% of cancer deaths. The main aspect of cachexia syndrome is the unstoppable skeletal muscle and fat storage wasting, even with an adequate caloric intake, resulting in nutrient mobilization - both directly as lipid and amino acids and indirectly as glucose derived from the exploitation of liver gluconeogenesis - that reaches the tumor through the bloodstream. From a metabolic standpoint, cachectic host develops a wide range of dysfunctions, from increased insulin and IGF-1 resistance to induction of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins and fat tissue browning resulting in an increased energy expenditure and heat generation, even at rest. For a long time, cachexia has been merely considered an epiphenomenon of end-stage tumors. However, in specific tumor types, such as pancreatic cancers, it is now clear that patients present markers of tissue wasting at a stage in which tumor is not yet clinically detectable, and that host amino acid supply is required for tumor growth. Indeed, tumor cells actively promote tissue wasting by secreting specific factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein and micro RNAs. Understanding the molecular and metabolic mediators of cachexia will not only advance therapeutic approaches against cancer, but also improve patients' quality of life.},

Prophylactic surgery has been traditionally considered in this setting in order to prevent subsequent complications of perforation, obstruction, or bleeding later during the treatment course, which may require urgent surgery associated with higher mortality. However, recent data have called into question the efficacy of this upfront surgical strategy. We provide a brief overview of how current combinations of systemic chemotherapy including fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and targeted biologic agents have allowed improved local (in addition to distant) tumor control, significantly decreasing the incidence of late primary-related complications requiring surgery from roughly 20\% in the era of single-agent fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy to almost 7\% in the era of modern triple-drug chemotherapy. In addition, we attempt to highlight those factors most associated with subsequent primary tumor-related complications in an effort to identify the subset of patients with synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer who might benefit from a surgery-first approach. Finally, we discuss modern nonsurgical options available for palliation of the primary colorectal tumor and review the outcome of patients for which emergent surgery is eventually required to address primary-related symptoms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle wasting is considered the central feature of cachexia, but the potential for skeletal muscle anabolism in patients with advanced cancer is unproven. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the clinical course of skeletal muscle wasting in advanced cancer and the window of possible muscle anabolism. DESIGN: We conducted a quantitative analysis of computed tomography (CT) images for the loss and gain of muscle in population-based cohorts of advanced cancer patients (lung, colorectal, and pancreas cancer and cholangiocarcinoma) in a longitudinal observational study. RESULTS: Advanced-cancer patients (n = 368; median survival: 196 d) had a total of 1279 CT images over the course of their disease. With consideration of all time points, muscle loss occurred in 39\% of intervals between any 2 scans. However, the overall frequency of muscle gain was 15.4\%, and muscle was stable in 45.6\% of intervals between any 2 scans, which made the maintenance or gain of muscle the predominant behavior. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that being within 90 d (compared with {$>$}90 d) from death was the principal risk factor for muscle loss (OR: 2.67; 95\% CI: 1.45, 4.94; P = 0.002), and muscle gain was correspondingly less likely (OR: 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.20, 0.69; P = 0.002) at this time. Sex, age, BMI, and tumor group were not significant predictors of muscle loss or gain. CONCLUSIONS: A window of anabolic potential exists at defined early phases of the disease trajectory ({$>$}90 d survival), creating an opportunity for nutritional intervention to stop or reverse cachexia. Cancer patients within 90 d of death have a low likelihood of anabolic potential.},

RECENT FINDINGS: One of the characteristics of cancer cachexia is the depletion of muscle with or without adipose tissue loss. Therefore, a body composition tool that specifically distinguishes between these tissues is essential in assessing this syndrome. Cancer patients are routinely evaluated by high resolution imaging such as CT for the purpose of diagnosis and follow-up. Recent work exploiting CT images for body composition analysis has revealed the natural history of cancer cachexia, including progressive alterations in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, organs, and tumor mass. CT-based quantification of skeletal muscle has permitted identification of individuals with sarcopenia, and links between sarcopenia and functional status, chemotherapy toxicity, time to tumor progression, and mortality. SUMMARY: CT images routinely acquired from health records of cancer patients can be used to quantify specific lean and adipose tissues, to interpret body composition in population-based studies, and to evaluate individual patients in a clinical and therapeutic decision-making setting.},

Data from a prospective study were used to determine if the highest doses of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) per kilogram LBM would be associated with dose-limiting toxicity in stage II/III colon cancer patients treated with 5-FU and leucovorin. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Toxicity after cycle 1 was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2.0. Muscle tissue was measured by computerized tomography. An extrapolation to the LBM compartment of the whole body was employed. RESULTS: Mean values of 5-FU/LBM of the entire population were different in terms of presence or absence of toxicity (P = 0.036). A cut point of 20 mg 5-FU/kg LBM seemed to be a threshold for developing toxicity (P = 0.005). This observation was pertinent to women (odds ratio, 16.73; P = 0.021). Women in this study had a relatively low proportion of LBM relative to their body surface area. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that low LBM is a significant predictor of toxicity in female patients administered 5-FU using the convention of dosing per unit of body surface area. We conclude that variation in toxicity between females and males may be partially explained by this feature of body composition.},

Post-operative chest pain was controlled in all patients by a standardized combination of oral and intravenous non-opioid analgesics. All patients had one chest tube (24 French). Static and dynamic (after forced expiratory effort) pain and FEV1 were assessed before and 1 h after the chest tube removal by the same operator. No additional analgesics were administered before or after the chest tube removal. The pain level was assessed by the numeric pain scale [range: 0 (no pain)-10 (excruciating pain)]. FEV1 was assessed by a portable spirometer. Bronchodilators were not used in these patients. Pre- and post-removal measurements were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: The average pre-removal static and dynamic pain scores were 2.6 and 4.1, respectively. The static and dynamic pain scores decreased by 42 and 41\%, respectively, after the tube removal (P {$<$} 0.0001). The average FEV1 before the chest tube removal was 1.5 l or 53\% of the predicted value and increased by 13\% after the tube removal (P = 0.0004). In total, 56 and 78\% of patients reported static and dynamic pain scores improvement and 67\% showed an FEV1 improvement after the chest tube removal. Similar results were observed in patients operated on through VATS or thoracotomy. Compared with patients whose chest tube was removed later, those who had their chest tube removed before post operative day 3 (POD3), showed a greater reduction in the static pain score (41 vs. 31\%, P = 0.05) and greater improvement in FEV1 (18 vs. 0.01\%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The removal of a chest tube reduces pain and improves ventilatory function, independent of surgical access and particularly in the early post-operative phase. A fast track chest tube removal policy may favour patients' recovery.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is becoming accepted as an established treatment for superficial esophageal squamous cell neoplasia, the majority of data on this endoscopic modality has been provided by Japanese series. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of ESD for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia in a consecutive series of patients treated in a Western setting. DESIGN AND SETTING: Single-center, prospective observational study. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: From January 2005 to July 2008, 20 patients with superficial esophageal squamous cell neoplasia were treated by ESD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Rates of en bloc resection, complete resection, and complications were evaluated as short-term outcomes. Overall survival, local or distant recurrence, and postoperative stricture rates were evaluated as long-term outcomes. RESULTS: ESD was performed in 20 patients (mean age 64 years, range 46-81 years; 16 men). The mean size of the lesion was 32 mm (range 15-60 mm); it was 30 mm or larger in 14 patients (70\%). The mean time of ESD was 89 minutes (range 58-180 minutes). En bloc resection with resection-free margins was achieved in 18 patients (90\%), whereas 2 patients presented with incomplete or indeterminate resection. Two cases (10\%) of mediastinal emphysema without overt perforation and 1 case (5\%) of post-ESD symptomatic stricture were reported. No local or distant post-ESD recurrence occurred in those with resection-free margins at a median follow-up of 18 months. LIMITATIONS: Small number of patients and limited follow-up. CONCLUSION: This Western series study confirms that ESD is a potentially curative treatment for superficial esophageal squamous cell neoplasia. Early and late complication rates were comparable to those of Japanese series. ESD should be probably considered as the treatment of choice in all large lesions amenable to endoscopic treatment.},

  abstract = {Background \& aims Computed tomographic (CT) imaging at third lumbar vertebra (L3), routinely used by oncologists, represents a reliable tool to quantify muscle mass. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of CT scan to define muscle mass as a prognostic marker in gastric cancer (GC) patients undergoing gastrectomy and/or chemotherapy. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and the secondary outcomes included postoperative length of hospital stay (P-LOS), total and severe complications in GC patients undergoing gastrectomy. Methods Three electronic bibliographic databases \textemdash{} MEDLINE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - were used to conduct a systematic literature search based on fixed inclusion and exclusion criteria, until April 2019. The adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) were used to analyse the dichotomous variables (OS, RFS, total and severe complications) and continuous variables (P-LOS). Random- and fixed effects models were used according to the heterogeneity. Results A total of 5610~GC patients from 20 studies were identified. Low muscle mass at diagnosis was found in 32.7\% of GC patients and was significantly associated with poorer OS (HR 2.02, 95\% CI 1.71\textendash 2.38, p~{$<~$}0.00001, I2~=~47\%) and worse RFS (HR 1.97, 95\% CI 1.71\textendash 2.26, p~{$<~$}0.00001, I2~=~0\%). Meta-analysis of adjusted HR from multivariable analyses confirmed the association between OS and low muscle mass (HR 1.89, 95\% CI 1.68\textendash 2.12, p~{$<~$}0.00001, I2~=~36\%). Furthermore, low muscle mass and poorer OS were significantly associated in metastatic GC patients exclusively undergoing chemotherapy (HR 1.61, 95\% CI 1.23\textendash 2.11, p~{$<~$}0.0006, I2~=~18\%). Moreover, preoperative low muscle mass was significantly associated with longer P-LOS (MD 1.19, 95\% CI 0.68\textendash 1.71, p~{$<~$}0.00001, I2~=~0\%), higher risk of postoperative complications (OR 1.76, 95\% CI 1.17\textendash 2.66, p~=~0.007, I2~=~77\%) and severe complications (OR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.03\textendash 2.29, p~=~0.04, I2~=~49\%) in GC patients undergoing gastrectomy. Conclusions Low muscle mass, assessed by L3 CT-scan, affects almost 1/3 of GC patients at diagnosis and acts as a negative prognostic marker on many clinical outcomes. Therefore, identifying GC patients with low muscle mass at diagnosis or at follow-up visit should be recommendable. Clinical nutritionists should be part of tumor boards meetings to screen low muscle mass in order to prompt personalized nutritional support.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy is commonly administered to patients with localized disease who have T3-4 esophageal disease as staged by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Previously, we noted that patients who present with dysphagia have a higher EUS T stage. We hypothesized that the presence of dysphagia is predictive of EUS T3-4 disease and that staging EUS could be forgone for esophageal cancer patients with dysphagia. METHODS: We performed a prospective, intent-to-treat, single-cohort study in which patients with potentially resectable esophageal cancer completed a standardized four-tier dysphagia score survey. EUS was performed as part of our standard evaluation. To determine whether the presence of dysphagia predicted EUS T3-4 disease, the dysphagia score was compared with EUS T stage. RESULTS: The study enrolled 114 consecutive patients between August 2012 and February 2014: 77\% (88 of 114) received neoadjuvant therapy, 18\% (20 of 114) did not, and 5\% (6 of 114) pursued treatment elsewhere. In total, 70\% (80 of 114) underwent esophagectomy; of these, 54\% (61 of 114) had dysphagia and 46\% (53 of 114) did not. Dysphagia scores were 66\% (40 of 61) grade 1, 25\% (15 of 61) grade 2, and 10\% (6 of 61) grade 3 to 4. Among patients with dysphagia, 89\% (54 of 61) had T3-4 disease by EUS; among those without dysphagia, only 53\% (28 of 53) had T3-4 disease by EUS (p {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of dysphagia in patients with esophageal cancer was highly predictive of T3-4 disease by EUS. On the basis of this finding, approximately 50\% of patients currently undergoing staging EUS at our institution could potentially forgo EUS before neoadjuvant therapy. Patients without dysphagia, however, should still undergo EUS.},

The NSABP R-03 (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project R-03) trial compared neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced rectal carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinical T3 or T4 or node-positive rectal cancer were randomly assigned to preoperative or postoperative chemoradiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of fluorouracil and leucovorin with 45 Gy in 25 fractions with a 5.40-Gy boost within the original margins of treatment. In the preoperative group, surgery was performed within 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. In the postoperative group, chemotherapy began after recovery from surgery but no later than 4 weeks after surgery. The primary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: From August 1993 to June 1999, 267 patients were randomly assigned to NSABP R-03. The intended sample size was 900 patients. Excluding 11 ineligible and two eligible patients without follow-up data, the analysis used data on 123 patients randomly assigned to preoperative and 131 to postoperative chemoradiotherapy. Surviving patients were observed for a median of 8.4 years. The 5-year DFS for preoperative patients was 64.7\% v 53.4\% for postoperative patients (P = .011). The 5-year OS for preoperative patients was 74.5\% v 65.6\% for postoperative patients (P = .065). A complete pathologic response was achieved in 15\% of preoperative patients. No preoperative patient with a complete pathologic response has had a recurrence. CONCLUSION: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy, compared with postoperative chemoradiotherapy, significantly improved DFS and showed a trend toward improved OS.},

  journal = {Clinical Nutrition},
  pages = {7},
  abstract = {Background \& aims: Patients with pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis, are often cachectic, and frequently demonstrate features of systemic inflammation, which may contribute to the phenomenon of myosteatosis. Analysis of body composition from CT scans has been used to study sarcopenia and its association with prognosis in a number of types of cancer, particular in combination with obesity. It has also been suggested that myosteatosis, defined as attenuated mean skeletal muscle Hounsfield units (HU), is associated with reduced survival in cancer. This study aimed to assess the association between body composition (sarcopenia and myosteatosis) and outcome in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Methods: All patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust between 2006 and 2013 were considered for the study. A total of 228 patients were included retrospectively. Body composition was assessed using cross-sectional CT analysis to calculate a skeletal muscle index (SMI) for sarcopenia and use mean skeletal muscle HU for myosteatosis. Results: The prevalence of sarcopenia in the whole patient group at baseline was 60.5\% (138/228). Overall, patients who were sarcopenic had no significant difference in overall survival versus those who were not (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.779). However, patients who were overweight/obese and sarcopenic had a significantly lower survival (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.013). Of the 58 patients who were overweight or obese and sarcopenic, 32 were also myosteatotic. The prevalence of myosteatosis overall at baseline was 55.3\% (126/228) and this was associated with significant reduction in overall survival (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.049). Univariate Cox regression revealed myosteatosis but not sarcopenia to be predictive of reduced survival, however this relationship was lost on multivariate testing. Myosteatosis was associated with significantly greater levels of systemic inflammation (white cell count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein), anaemia and worsening of baseline blood urea. This relationship was not seen with sarcopenia. Conclusions: This is the largest study on the association between body composition and survival in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer and has shown that although sarcopenia alone did not have a bearing on survival, the presence of myosteatosis was associated significantly with the presence of systemic inflammation and reduced survival.},

This study aims to investigate the relationship between frailty and computed tomography (CT)-derived sarcopenia with length of stay and mortality in older burn patients. Burn patients {$\geq$}60 years old admitted between 2008 and 2017 who had chest or abdomen CT scans within 1 week of admission were evaluated. Frailty was assessed using the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Sarcopenia was assessed on CT exams by measuring skeletal muscle index (SMI) of paraspinal muscles at T12 and all skeletal muscles at L3. The relationship between frailty scores and SMI with length of stay (LOS) and mortality was determined using logistic regression. Eighty-three patients (59 men; mean age 70.2 {$\pm$} 8.5 years) had chest (n = 50) or abdomen (n = 60) CT scans. Mean TBSA = 14.3 {$\pm$} 14.0\%, LOS = 25.8 {$\pm$} 21.3 days, CFS = 4.36 {$\pm$} 0.99. Sixteen patients (19.3\%) died while in the hospital. CT-derived measurement of SMI at T12 was significantly associated with LOS (P {$<$} .05), but not with mortality (P = .561). CT-derived metrics at L3 were not significantly associated with outcomes. CFS was not associated with LOS (P = .836) or mortality (P = .554). In older burn patients, low SMI of the paraspinal muscles at T12 was associated with longer LOS.},

METHODS: Four hundred thirteen patients with esophageal cancer who presented to Roswell Park Cancer Institute from 1991 to 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data, perioperative details, and postoperative courses were compared for patients older and younger than 70 years. RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven patients (36\%) were older than 70 years. Risk factors, clinical symptoms, histology, and stage at presentation were equivalent for both age groups. A higher percentage of patients {$<$}70 years were candidates for curative resection. There were no significant differences between groups for estimated blood loss, intraoperative transfusions, length of stay, overall morbidity, or mortality. Only postoperative myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation were increased in the older group. Excluding stage IV disease, there was a significant and similar improvement in median survival after resection for patients both {$<$}70 years and {$>$}70 years. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, esophageal cancer in older patients warrants surgical resection because the benefit to the patient is the same as it is for younger patients, without a significant increase in operative morbidity or mortality.},

  abstract = {Purpose Few patients 75 years of age and older participate in clinical trials, thus whether adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer (CC) benefits this group is unknown. Methods A total of 5,489 patients Ն 75 years of age with resected stage III CC, diagnosed between 2004 and 2007, were selected from four data sets containing demographic, stage, treatment, and survival information. These data sets included SEER-Medicare, a linkage between the New York State Cancer Registry (NYSCR) and its Medicare programs, and prospective cohort studies Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Data sets were analyzed in parallel using covariate adjusted and propensity score (PS) matched proportional hazards models to evaluate the effect of treatment on survival. PS trimming was used to mitigate the effects of selection bias. Results Use of adjuvant therapy declined with age and comorbidity. Chemotherapy receipt was associated with a survival benefit of comparable magnitude to clinical trials results (SEER-Medicare PSmatched mortality, hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.68). The incremental benefit of oxaliplatin over non\textendash{} oxaliplatin-containing regimens was also of similar magnitude to clinical trial results (SEER-Medicare, HR, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.69 to 1.04; NYSCR-Medicare, HR, 0.82, 95\% CI, 0.51 to 1.33) in two of three examined data sources. However, statistical significance was inconsistent. The beneficial effect of chemotherapy and oxaliplatin did not seem solely attributable to confounding. Conclusion The noninvestigational experience suggests patients with stage III CC Ն 75 years of age may anticipate a survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Oxaliplatin offers no more than a small incremental benefit. Use of adjuvant chemotherapy after the age of 75 years merits consideration in discussions that weigh individual risks and preferences.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Endoscopic biopsy after chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for esophageal cancer has been used to determine response to treatment. We wanted to determine if endoscopic biopsy can accurately establish evidence of local pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients undergoing CRT. METHODS: We queried a prospectively maintained database for patients seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 1996 to the present who underwent, (1) CRT for local-regionally advanced esophageal cancer, (2) post-CRT endoscopic biopsy, and (3) esophagectomy. Data points included pathology of post-CRT endoscopy and surgical specimens, tumor histology, and survival. Correlations were analyzed by the chi2 test and one-way analysis of variance. Survival comparisons were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank analysis. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-six patients were identified. Over 80\% of patients received cisplatin-based chemotherapy and 5040 cGy of radiation. One hundred eighteen patients had no tumor identified on endoscopic biopsy. A negative biopsy at endoscopy was a poor predictor of pCR (negative predictive value: 31\%), with 69\% having local disease at esophagectomy. A positive biopsy was predictive of residual disease (positive predictive value: 95\%). Negative endoscopic biopsy better predicted a pCR for squamous cell carcinomas versus adenocarcinomas (P[r] {$<$} 0.001). Nodal status of surgical specimens was not correlated with post-treatment endoscopic findings. Survival was equivalent after surgery in patients with a negative endoscopic biopsy versus patients with positive pathology. CONCLUSION: A negative endoscopic biopsy is not a useful predictor of a pCR after CRT, final nodal status, or overall survival.},

  abstract = {AIM: The standard treatment for patients with clinically resectable rectal cancer is surgery. Postoperative radiochemotherapy is recommended for patients with advanced disease (pT3/4 or pN+). In recent years, encouraging results of preoperative radiotherapy have been reported. This prospective randomized phase-III trial (CAO/ARO/AIO-94) compares the efficacy of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to standard postoperative radiochemotherapy. We report on the design of the study and first results with regard to toxicity of radiochemotherapy and postoperative morbidity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced operable rectal cancer (uT3/4 or uN+, Mason CS III/IV) were randomly assigned to pre- or postoperative radiochemotherapy: A total dose of 50.4 Gy (single dose 1.8 Gy) was applied to the tumor and the pelvic lymph nodes. 5-FU (1,000 mg/m2/d) was administered concomitantly in the first and fifth week of radiation as 120-h continuous infusion. Four additional cycles of 5-FU chemotherapy (500 mg/m2/d, i.v. bolus) were applied. Radiochemotherapy was identical in both arms except for a small-volume boost of 5.4 Gy in the postoperative setting. Time interval between radiochemotherapy and surgery was 4-6 weeks in both arms. Techniques of surgery were standardized and included total mesorectal excision. In addition, stratification according to surgeons involved has been provided for. Primary endpoints of the study are 5-year overall-survival, local and distant control, secondary endpoints include rate of curative (R0) resections and sphincter saving procedures, toxicity of radiochemotherapy, surgical complications and quality of life. RESULTS: As of 15th November 2000, 628 patients were randomized from 26 participating institutions: 310 patients were randomized to postoperative radiochemotherapy, 318 patients to preoperative radiochemotherapy. Acute toxicity (WHO) of radiochemotherapy was low, with less than 15\% of patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher toxicity: The principal toxicity was diarrhea, with 12\% in the postoperative radiochemotherapy arm and 10\% in the preoperative radiochemotherapy arm having Grade-3, and 1\% in either arm having Grade-4 diarrhea. Erythema, nausea and leukopenia were the next common toxicities, with less than 3\% of patients in either arm suffering Grade 3 or greater leukopenia or nausea. Postoperative complication rates were similar in both arms, with 12\% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 13\% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) of patients, respectively, suffering from anastomotic leakage, 4\% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 3\% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) from postoperative bleeding, and 6\% (postoperative radiochemotherapy) and 5\% (preoperative radiochemotherapy) from delayed wound healing. CONCLUSION: The patient accrual of our trial is satisfactory, neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is well tolerated and bears no higher risk for postoperative morbidity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment guidelines for stage I-III esophageal cancer indicate that management should include surgery in appropriate patients. Variations in utilization of surgery may contribute to racial differences observed in survival. We sought to identify factors associated with racial disparities in surgical resection of esophageal cancer and evaluate associated survival differences. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with stage I-III esophageal cancer from 2004 to 2015 were identified using the National Cancer Database. Matched patient cohorts were created to reduce confounding. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receipt of surgery. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization. RESULTS: A total of 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients evenly distributed across race. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95\% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malnutrition after esophageal cancer surgery is associated with reduced health-related qualify of life. Therefore, a prediction model identifying patients at risk for severe weight loss after surgery was developed. METHODS: Data from a Swedish population-based cohort study, including 616 patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery in 2001-2005, was used. Candidate predictors included risk factors available before and immediately after surgery. Severe weight loss was defined as {$\geq$}\,15\% loss of body weight between the time of surgery and 6~months postoperatively. The prediction model was developed using multivariable models. The accuracy of the model was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) with bootstrap validation. The model was externally validated in a hospital-based cohort of 91 surgically treated esophageal cancer patients in the United Kingdom in 2011-2016. Each predictor in the final model was assigned a corresponding risk score. The sum of risk scores was equivalent to an estimated probability for severe weight loss. RESULTS: Among the 351 patients with 6~months follow-up data, 125 (36\%) suffered from severe postoperative weight loss. The final prediction model included body mass index at diagnosis, preoperative weight loss, and neoadjuvant therapy. The AUC for the model was 0.78 (95\% CI 0.74-0.83). In the validation cohort, the AUC was 0.76. A clinical risk assessment guide was derived from the prediction model. CONCLUSIONS: This prediction model can preoperatively identify individuals with high risk of severe weight loss after esophageal cancer surgery. Intensive nutritional interventions for these patients are recommended.},

  abstract = {The incidence of esophageal cancer has increased steadily in the last decades in the United States. The aim of this paper was to characterize disparities in esophageal cancer treatment in different racial and socioeconomic population groups and compare long-term survival among different treatment modalities. A retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database was performed including adult patients ({$\geq$}18 years old) with a diagnosis of resectable (stages I-III) esophageal cancer between 2004 and 2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. In conclusion, underserved patients with esophageal cancer appear to have limited access to surgical care, and are, in fact, more likely to not be offered any treatment at all. Considering the survival benefits associated with surgical resection, greater public health efforts to reduce disparities in esophageal cancer are needed.},

  abstract = {Background: Malnutrition in gastrectomized patients receiving chemotherapy is associated with the susceptibility to chemotherapy-related adverse events. This study evaluated pre-operative nutritional status-related indices associated with adverse events in post-operation gastric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Methods: Medical records of 234 gastrectomized patients under adjuvant tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil chemotherapy with extended lymph node dissection were analyzed. Nutritional status assessment included Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), body weight, body mass index, serum albumin concentration, and Nutrition Risk Index (NRI). Chemotherapy-originated adverse events were determined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Results: PG-SGA indicated 59\% of the patients were malnourished, and 27.8\% of the patients revealed serious malnutrition with PG-SGA score of {$\geq$}9. Fifteen \% of patients lost {$\geq$}10\% of the initial body weight, 14.5\% of the patients had hypoalbuminemia ({$<$}3.5 g/dL), and 66.2\% had NRI score less than 97.5 indicating moderate to severe malnutrition. Hematological adverse events were present in 94\% ({$\geq$}grade 1) and 16.2\% ({$\geq$}grade 3). Non-hematological adverse events occurred in 95.7\% ({$\geq$}grade1) and 16.7\% ({$\geq$}grade 3) of the patients. PG-SGA and NRI score was not associated with treatment-induced adverse events. Multivariate analyses indicated that female, low body mass index, and hypoalbuminemia were independent risk factors for grade 3/4 hematological adverse events. Age was an independent risk factor for grade 3/4 non-hematological adverse events. Neutropenia was the most frequently occurring adverse event, and associated risk factors were female, total gastrectomy, and hypoalbuminemia. Conclusions: Hypoalbuminemia, not PG-SGA or NRI may predict chemotherapy-induced adverse events in gastrectomized cancer patients.},

This study investigates SM measures in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients receiving first line taxane-based chemotherapy and evaluates associations with treatment toxicity and other outcomes. Experimental Design\textemdash Using computerized tomography (CT) images taken for the evaluation of disease burden, skeletal muscle area (SMA) and density (SMD) were measured at the 3rd lumbar vertebrae. Sarcopenia was defined as Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI=SMA/height2) {$\leq$}41. Skeletal Muscle Gauge (SMG) was created by multiplying SMI x SMD. Fisher's exact tests, ttests, the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression modeling were used. Results\textemdash MBC patients (N=40), median age 55 (rang 34\textendash 80), 58\% sarcopenic, median SMG 1296 AU (SD 522). Grade 3\textendash 4 toxicity was found in 57\% of sarcopenic vs 18\% of non-sarcopenic patients (p=0.02). Toxicity-related hospitalizations were also higher in sarcopenic patients (39\% vs 0\%, p=0.005) as were any adverse events -- defined as any grade 3\textendash 4 toxicities, hospitalizations, dose reductions, or dose delay -- (74\% vs 35\%, p=0.02). Low SMG was associated with grade 3\textendash 4 toxicity (p=0.04), hospitalization (p=0.01) and time to treatment failure (for progression or toxicity) (p=0.03). Low SMG had a borderline significant association with any adverse event (p=0.06) and overall survival (p=0.07). Conclusions\textemdash SM measures are associated with toxicity outcomes and survival in MBC patients receiving first line taxane-based chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to explore how routinely obtained CT scans can be used to individualize dosing and improve treatment planning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Barrett's esophagus, a condition of intestinal metaplasia of the esophagus, is associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. We assessed whether endoscopic radiofrequency ablation could eradicate dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and decrease the rate of neoplastic progression. METHODS: In a multicenter, sham-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 127 patients with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus in a 2:1 ratio to receive either radiofrequency ablation (ablation group) or a sham procedure (control group). Randomization was stratified according to the grade of dysplasia and the length of Barrett's esophagus. Primary outcomes at 12 months included the complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analyses, among patients with low-grade dysplasia, complete eradication of dysplasia occurred in 90.5\% of those in the ablation group, as compared with 22.7\% of those in the control group (P{$<$}0.001). Among patients with high-grade dysplasia, complete eradication occurred in 81.0\% of those in the ablation group, as compared with 19.0\% of those in the control group (P{$<$}0.001). Overall, 77.4\% of patients in the ablation group had complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia, as compared with 2.3\% of those in the control group (P{$<$}0.001). Patients in the ablation group had less disease progression (3.6\% vs. 16.3\%, P=0.03) and fewer cancers (1.2\% vs. 9.3\%, P=0.045). Patients reported having more chest pain after the ablation procedure than after the sham procedure. In the ablation group, one patient had upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and five patients (6.0\%) had esophageal stricture. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with dysplastic Barrett's esophagus, radiofrequency ablation was associated with a high rate of complete eradication of both dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and a reduced risk of disease progression.

In this document, the American College of Gastroenterology updates its guidance for the best practices in caring for these patients. These guidelines continue to endorse screening of high-risk patients for BE; however, routine screening is limited to men with reflux symptoms and multiple other risk factors. Acknowledging recent data on the low risk of malignant progression in patients with nondysplastic BE, endoscopic surveillance intervals are attenuated in this population; patients with nondysplastic BE should undergo endoscopic surveillance no more frequently than every 3-5 years. Neither routine use of biomarker panels nor advanced endoscopic imaging techniques (beyond high-definition endoscopy) is recommended at this time. Endoscopic ablative therapy is recommended for patients with BE and high-grade dysplasia, as well as T1a esophageal adenocarcinoma. Based on recent level 1 evidence, endoscopic ablative therapy is also recommended for patients with BE and low-grade dysplasia, although endoscopic surveillance continues to be an acceptable alternative. Given the relatively common recurrence of BE after ablation, we suggest postablation endoscopic surveillance intervals. Although many of the recommendations provided are based on weak evidence or expert opinion, this document provides a pragmatic framework for the care of the patient with BE.},

These guidelines have been developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology and its Practice Parameters Committee and approved by the Board of Trustees. The following guidelines are based on a critical review of the available scientific literature on the topic identified in Medline and PubMed (January 1992-December 2008) using search terms that included stents, self-expandable metal stents, self-expandable plastic stents, esophageal cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal stricture, perforations, anastomotic leaks, tracheoesophageal fistula, and achalasia. These guidelines are intended for use by health-care providers and apply to adult, but not pediatric, patients. As with other practice guidelines, these guidelines are not intended to replace clinical judgment but rather to provide general guidelines applicable to the majority of patients. Clinicians need to integrate recommendations with their own clinical judgment, and with individual patient circumstances, values, and preferences. They are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies designed to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations have been assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, which is a system that has been adopted by multiple national and international societies. The GRADE system is based on a sequential assessment of quality of evidence, followed by assessment of the balance between benefits vs. downsides (harms, burden, and costs) and subsequent judgment regarding the strength of recommendation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has been advantageous for lowering pulmonary complications compared with open approaches.(1) However, pulmonary complications remain the most common morbidity after surgical resection of esophageal cancer.(2,3) The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial was designed to see whether low tidal volume (VT) could further minimize pulmonary complications after MIE. METHODS: Between June 2011 and July 2012, a total of 101 patients who underwent MIE received left-lung ventilation during thoracoscopic esophagectomy. All patients received left-lung ventilation during thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to a low VT (5 mL/kg + 5 cm H2O positive end-expiratory pressure) preserved ventilation (PV) group (n~=~53) and a conventional VT (8 mL/kg) controlled ventilation (CV) group (n~=~48) in the thoracic stage. Alveolar lavage fluid was harvested from the ventilated lung at intubation and at 18 hours after surgery for analysis of interleukin (IL)-1\ss, IL-6, and IL-8 levels. Clinical characteristics, including patient demographics, operation features, and changes in oxygenation index, were recorded and analyzed. Pulmonary complications were identified and statistically compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics and operation features were comparable between the 2 groups. IL-1\ss, IL-6, and IL-8 expressions in preoperative alveolar lavage fluid were similar between the 2 groups. Significantly lower~IL expressions were observed in the PV group than those in the CV group at 18 hours after MIE (IL-1\ss, 25.42 {$\pm$} 31.01 vs 94.96 {$\pm$} 118.24 pg/mL; IL-6, 30.86 {$\pm$} 75.78 vs 92.99 {$\pm$} 72.90 pg/mL; IL-8, 258.75~{$\pm$} 188.24 vs 403.95 {$\pm$} 151.44 pg/mL; all P~{$<~$}.05). The 18-hour postoperative oxygenation index was lower in the CV group than that in the PV group (292.85 {$\pm$} 28.74 vs 326.35 {$\pm$} 34.43; P~=~.046). Pulmonary complications were observed in 18 cases of our series, occurring more frequently on the ventilation side (right, 6 cases; and left, 12 cases). All patients were cured by conservative therapy without severe sequelae. The~occurrence of pulmonary complications in the PV group was lower than that in the CV group (9.43\%~vs~27.08\%; P~=~.021). CONCLUSIONS: Lung injury due to intraoperative single-lung ventilation may contribute to pulmonary complications after MIE. Low VT ventilation could decrease ventilation-associated lung inflammation, thus minimizing pulmonary complications after MIE. Further studies, based on a larger volume of populations, are required to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {A single abdominal cross-sectional computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance image is often obtained in studies examining adipose tissue (AT) distribution. An abdominal image might also provide additional useful information on total body skeletal muscle (SM) and AT volumes with related physiological insights. We therefore investigated the relationships between abdominal SM and AT areas from single images and total body component volumes in a large and diverse sample of healthy adult subjects. Total body SM and AT volumes were derived by whole body multislice magnetic resonance imaging in 123 men [age (mean +/- SD) of 41.6 +/- 15.8 yr; body mass index of 25.9 +/- 3.4 kg/m(2)] and 205 women (age of 47.8 +/- 18.7 yr; body mass index of 26.7 +/- 5.6 kg/m(2)). Single abdominal SM and AT slice areas were highly correlated with total body SM (r = 0.71-0.92; r = 0.90 at L(4)-L(5) intervertebral space) and AT (r = 0.84-0.96; r = 0.94 at L(4)-L(5) intervertebral space) volumes, respectively. R(2) increased by only 5.7-6.1\% for SM and 2.7-4.4\% for AT with the inclusion of subject sex, age, ethnicity, scanning position, body mass index, and waist circumference in the model. The developed SM and AT models were validated in an additional 49 subjects. To achieve equivalent power to a study measuring total body SM or AT volumes, a study using a single abdominal image would require 17-24\% more subjects for SM and 6-12\% more subjects for AT. Measurement of a single abdominal image can thus provide estimates of total body SM and AT for group studies of healthy adults.},

Visceral adipose tissue is a hormonally active component of total body fat, which possesses unique biochemical characteristics that influence several normal and pathological processes in the human body. Abnormally high deposition of visceral adipose tissue is known as visceral obesity. This body composition phenotype is associated with medical disorders such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and several malignancies including prostate, breast and colorectal cancers. Quantitative assessment of visceral obesity is important for evaluating the potential risk of development of these pathologies, as well as providing an accurate prognosis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The border between the esophagus and stomach gives rise to many discrepancies in the current literature regarding the etiology, classification and surgical treatment of adenocarcinoma arising at the esophago-gastric junction. We have consequently used the AEG-criteria (adenocarcinoma of the esophago-gastric junction) for classification and have based the selection of the surgical approach on the anatomic topographic subclassification. METHODS: In the following we report an analysis of a large and homogeneously classified population of 1602 consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophago-gastric junction, with an emphasis on the surgical approach, the pattern of lymphatic spread, the outcome after surgical treatment and the prognostic factors. Demographic data, morphologic and histopathologic tumor characteristics, and long-term survival rates were compared among the three tumor subclassifiations. RESULTS: The study confirms the marked differences in sex distribution, associated specialized intestinal metaplasia in the esophagus, tumor grading, tumor growth pattern, lymphatic spread, and stage between the three tumor entities. The degree of resection and lymph node status were the dominating independent prognostic factors by multivariate analysis. The data show no significant differences of long-term survival after abdomino-thoracic esophagectomy and extended total gastrectomy in these patients. CONCLUSION: The classification of adenocarcinomas of the esophago-gastric junction in three types, AEG type I, type II and type III shows marked differences between the tumor entities and is recommended for selection of a proper surgical approach. Complete tumor resection and adequate lymphadenectomy are associated with good long-term prognosis. Better surgical management and standardized procedures will improve the outcome also of patients who need to undergo more radical surgery, i.e. abdomino-thoracic esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate sarcopenia as a predictor of postoperative risk of major and total complications after surgery for gastrointestinal cancer. BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is associated with poor survival in gastrointestinal cancer patients, but the role of sarcopenia as prognostic tool in surgical oncology has not been established, and no consensus exists regarding assessment and management of sarcopenic patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic search for citations in EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed from 2004 to January 31, 2017. Random effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the pooled risk ratio for postoperative complications by Clavien-Dindo grade (total complications: grade {$\geq$}2; major complications: grade {$\geq$}3) in patients with sarcopenia versus patients without sarcopenia. Stratified analyses were performed by sarcopenia criteria, cutoff level, assessment methods, study quality, cancer diagnosis, and "Enhanced Recovery After Surgery" care. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies (n = 7176) were included with sarcopenia prevalence ranging between 12\% and 78\%. Preoperative incidence of sarcopenia was associated with increased risk of major complications (risk ratio 1.40; 95\% confidence interval, 1.20-1.64; P {$<$} 0.001; I = 52\%) and total complications (risk ratio 1.35; 95\% confidence interval, 1.12-1.61; P = 0.001; I = 60\%). Moderate heterogeneity was found for both meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed that sarcopenia remained a consistent risk factor across stratification by sarcopenia criteria, assessment methods, study quality, and diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia was associated with an increased risk of complications after gastrointestinal tumor resection, but lack of methodological consensus hampers the interpretation and clinical utilization of these findings. Combining assessment of muscle mass with measures of physical function may increase the prognostic value and accuracy in preoperative risk stratification.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent research suggests a significant relationship between lean body mass (LBM) and toxicity from chemotherapeutic agents. We investigated if higher drug doses per kg LBM were associated with increased toxicity in stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving a first-line chemotherapy regimen dosed according to body surface area (BSA). Methods: Data from patients randomised to receive intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 plus orally vinorelbine 60 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 in a phase III trial comparing two chemotherapy regimens were analysed. LBM was estimated from assessment of the cross-sectional muscle area at the third lumbar level (L3) on computed tomography images obtained before chemotherapy commenced. Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade 3\textendash 4 haematological toxicity and dose reduction and/or stop of treatment after the first course of chemotherapy were defined as primary and secondary toxicity outcomes. Results: The study sample included 153 patients, mean age was 66 years, 55\% were men, 87\% had disease stage IV and 75\% had performance status (PS) 0\textendash 1. Gemcitabine doses per kg LBM varied from 23.2 to 53.1 mg/kg LBM, and vinorelbine doses from 1.5 to 3.3 mg/kg LBM. Higher doses of gemcitabine per kg LBM were significantly associated with grade 3\textendash 4 haematological toxicity in bivariate (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI 1.03\textendash 1.23, p = 0.008) and multivariate analyses (OR = 1.15, 95\% CI 1.01\textendash 1.29, p = 0.018), as were also higher doses of vinorelbine per kg LBM. No significant association was found between drug doses per kg LBM and dose reduction and/or stop of treatment. Conclusion: The study showed that dose estimates according to BSA lead to a substantial variation in drug dose per kg LBM, and higher doses per kg LBM are a significant predictor for chemotherapy-induced haematological toxicity. The results indicate that taking LBM into account may lead to a better dose individualisation of chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Background \& aims: Recent research indicates that severe muscular depletion (sarcopenia) is frequent in cancer patients and linked to cachexia and poor survival. Our aim was to investigate if measures of skeletal muscle hold prognostic information in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: We included NSCLC patients with disease stage IIIB/IV, performance status 0e2, enrolled in three randomised trials of first-line chemotherapy (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1305). Computed tomography (CT) images obtained before start of treatment were used for body composition analyses at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Skeletal muscle mass was assessed by measures of the cross sectional muscle area, from which the skeletal muscle index (SMI) was obtained. Skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) was measured as the mean Hounsfield unit (HU) of the measured muscle area. A high level of mean HU indicates a high SMD. Results: Complete data were available for 734 patients, mean age 65 years. Both skeletal muscle index (SMI) and muscle radiodensity (SMD) varied largely. Mean SMI and SMD were 47.7 cm2/m2 and 37.4 HU in men (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 420), 39.6 cm2/m2 and 37.0 HU in women (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 314). Multivariable Cox regression analyses, adjusted for established prognostic factors, showed that SMD was independently prognostic for survival (Hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95\% CI 0.97e0.99, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001), whereas SMI was not (HR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.98e1.01, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.329). Conclusion: Low SMD is associated with poorer survival in advanced NSCLC. Further research is warranted to establish whether muscle measures should be integrated into routine practice to improve prognostic accuracy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous meta-analysis, we identified a survival benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy before surgery in patients with resectable oesophageal carcinoma. We updated this meta-analysis with results from new or updated randomised trials presented in the past 3 years. We also compared the benefits of preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: To identify additional studies and published abstracts from major scientific meetings, we searched Medline, Embase, and Central (Cochrane clinical trials database) for studies published since January, 2006, and also manually searched for abstracts from major conferences from the same period. Only randomised studies analysed by intention to treat were included, and searches were restricted to those databases citing articles in English. We used published hazard ratios (HRs) if available or estimates from other survival data. We also investigated treatment effects by tumour histology and relations between risk (survival after surgery alone) and effect size. FINDINGS: We included all 17 trials from the previous meta-analysis and seven further studies. 12 were randomised comparisons of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus surgery alone (n=1854), nine were randomised comparisons of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery alone (n=1981), and two compared neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=194) in patients with resectable oesophageal carcinoma; one factorial trial included two comparisons and was included in analyses of both neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (n=78) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=81). The updated analysis contained 4188 patients whereas the previous publication included 2933 patients. This updated meta-analysis contains about 3500 events compared with about 2230 in the previous meta-analysis (estimated 57\% increase). The HR for all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was 0.78 (95\% CI 0.70-0.88; p{$<$}0.0001); the HR for squamous-cell carcinoma only was 0.80 (0.68-0.93; p=0.004) and for adenocarcinoma only was 0.75 (0.59-0.95; p=0.02). The HR for all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 0.87 (0.79-0.96; p=0.005); the HR for squamous-cell carcinoma only was 0.92 (0.81-1.04; p=0.18) and for adenocarcinoma only was 0.83 (0.71-0.95; p=0.01). The HR for the overall indirect comparison of all-cause mortality for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 0.88 (0.76-1.01; p=0.07). INTERPRETATION: This updated meta-analysis provides strong evidence for a survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy over surgery alone in patients with oesophageal carcinoma. A clear advantage of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy over neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been established. These results should help inform decisions about patient management and design of future trials. FUNDING: Cancer Australia and the NSW Cancer Institute.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Surgical resection of gastric cancer has produced suboptimal survival despite multiple randomized trials that used postoperative chemotherapy or more aggressive surgical procedures. We performed a randomized phase III trial of postoperative radiochemotherapy in those at moderate risk of locoregional failure (LRF) following surgery. We originally reported results with 4-year median follow-up. This update, with a more than 10-year median follow-up, presents data on failure patterns and second malignancies and explores selected subset analyses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 559 patients with primaries {$\geq$} T3 and/or node-positive gastric cancer were randomly assigned to observation versus radiochemotherapy after R0 resection. Fluorouracil and leucovorin were administered before, during, and after radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was given to all LRF sites to a dose of 45 Gy. RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) data demonstrate continued strong benefit from postoperative radiochemotherapy. The hazard ratio (HR) for OS is 1.32 (95\% CI, 1.10 to 1.60; P = .0046). The HR for RFS is 1.51 (95\% CI, 1.25 to 1.83; P {$<$} .001). Adjuvant radiochemotherapy produced substantial reduction in both overall relapse and locoregional relapse. Second malignancies were observed in 21 patients with radiotherapy versus eight with observation (P = .21). Subset analyses show robust treatment benefit in most subsets, with the exception of patients with diffuse histology who exhibited minimal nonsignificant treatment effect. CONCLUSION: Intergroup 0116 (INT-0116) demonstrates strong persistent benefit from adjuvant radiochemotherapy. Toxicities, including second malignancies, appear acceptable, given the magnitude of RFS and OS improvement. LRF reduction may account for the majority of overall relapse reduction. Adjuvant radiochemotherapy remains a rational standard therapy for curatively resected gastric cancer with primaries T3 or greater and/or positive nodes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with non-metastatic, locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) includes pre-operative chemoradiation, total mesorectal excision (TME) and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. This trimodality treatment provides local tumor control in most patients; but almost one-third ultimately die from distant metastasis. Most survivors experience significant impairment in quality of life (QoL), due primarily to removal of the rectum. A current challenge lies in identifying patients who could safely undergo rectal preservation without sacrificing survival benefit and QoL. METHODS/DESIGN: This multi-institutional, phase II study investigates the efficacy of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) and selective non-operative management (NOM) in LARC. Patients with MRI-staged Stage II or III rectal cancer amenable to TME will be randomized to receive FOLFOX/CAPEOX: a) before induction neoadjuvant chemotherapy (INCT); or b) after consolidation neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CNCT), with 5-FU or capecitabine-based chemoradiation. Patients in both arms will be re-staged after completing all neoadjuvant therapy. Those with residual tumor at the primary site will undergo TME. Patients with clinical complete response (cCR) will receive non-operative management (NOM). NOM patients will be followed every 3 months for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter. TME patients will be followed according to NCCN guidelines. All will be followed for at least 5 years from the date of surgery or--in patients treated with NOM--the last day of treatment. DISCUSSION: The studies published thus far on the safety of NOM in LARC have compared survival between select groups of patients with a cCR after NOM, to patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) after TME. The current study compares 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) in an entire population of patients with LARC, including those with cCR and those with pCR. We will compare the two arms of the study with respect to organ preservation at 3 years, treatment compliance, adverse events and surgical complications. We will measure QoL in both groups. We will analyze molecular indications that may lead to more individually tailored treatments in the future. This will be the first NOM trial utilizing a regression schema for response assessment in a prospective fashion. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02008656.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The watch-and-wait (WW) strategy aims to spare patients with rectal cancer unnecessary resection. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of WW among patients with rectal cancer who had a clinical complete response to neoadjuvant therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective case series analysis conducted at a comprehensive cancer center in New York included patients who received a diagnosis of rectal adenocarcinoma between January 1, 2006, and January 31, 2015. The median follow-up was 43 months. Data analyses were conducted from June 1, 2016, to October 1, 2018. EXPOSURES: Patients had a clinical complete response after completing neoadjuvant therapy and agreed to a WW strategy of active surveillance and possible salvage surgery (n\,=\,113), or patients underwent total mesorectal excision and were found to have a pathologic complete response (pCR) at resection (n\,=\,136). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for analyses of local regrowth and 5-year rates of overall survival, disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Compared with the 136 patients in the pCR group, the 113 patients in the WW group were older (median [range], 67.2 [32.1-90.9] vs 57.3 [25.0-87.9] years, P\,{$<$}\,.001) with cancers closer to the anal verge (median [range] height from anal verge, 5.5 [0.0-15.0] vs 7.0 [0.0-13.0] cm). All 22 local regrowths in the WW group were detected on routine surveillance and treated by salvage surgery (20 total mesorectal excisions plus 2 transanal excisions). Pelvic control after salvage surgery was maintained in 20 of 22 patients (91\%). No pelvic recurrences occurred in the pCR group. Rectal preservation was achieved in 93 of 113 patients (82\%) in the WW group (91 patients with no local regrowths plus 2 patients with local regrowths salvaged with transanal excision). At 5 years, overall survival was 73\% (95\% CI, 60\%-89\%) in the WW group and 94\% (95\% CI, 90\%-99\%) in the pCR group; disease-free survival was 75\% (95\% CI, 62\%-90\%) in the WW group and 92\% (95\% CI, 87\%-98\%) in the pCR group; and disease-specific survival was 90\% (95\% CI, 81\%-99\%) in the WW group and 98\% (95\% CI, 95\%-100\%) in the pCR group. A higher rate of distant metastasis was observed among patients in the WW group who had local regrowth vs those who did not have local regrowth (36\% vs 1\%, P\,{$<$}\,.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A WW strategy for select rectal cancer patients who had a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant therapy resulted in excellent rectal preservation and pelvic tumor control; however, in the WW group, worse survival was noted along with a higher incidence of distant progression in patients with local regrowth vs those without local regrowth.},

  abstract = {Long term health related quality of life (HRQL) and nutritional outcome of patients following esophagectomy for cancer has become increasingly significant as the 5-year survival rate in this patient group is increasing. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the HRQOL, nutritional impact symptoms and nutritional outcomes of patients following an esophagectomy at greater than 12~months after surgery. In studies reporting on HRQL as an outcome, global QOL score at 6-month compare to greater than 12-month showed no statistically significant difference (65.92~vs. 75.78, p = 0.07). Forty-one percent of patients reported a greater than 10\% weight loss at six-month follow-up (95\% CI: 20-65\%; I2 = 94.27, p {$<$} 0.001), and at the greater than 12-month follow-up, 33\% of patients had the greater than 10\% weight loss (95\% CI: 15-57\%; I2 = 96.18, p {$<$} 0.001). At the 12-month or longer post esophagectomy, just over half the patients reported dysphagia (51\%, 95\% CI: 25-76\%; I2 = 95.70, p {$<$} 0.001), nausea was reported by 11\% (95\% CI: 7-19\%; I2 = 59.31, p = 0.09), dumping syndrome reported by 60\% (95\% CI: 43-76\%; I2 = 96.92, p {$<$} 0.001). Symptoms such as dysphagia, diarrhea, reflux, dumping syndrome, and nausea were found to persist following esophagectomy. There were insufficient robust research investigating how these symptoms impact on the adequacy of dietary intake and micronutrient status.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study compared survival after initial treatment with esophagectomy as primary therapy to induction therapy followed by esophagectomy for patients with clinical T2N0 (cT2N0) esophageal cancer in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). METHODS: Predictors of therapy selection for patients with cT2N0 esophageal cancer in the NCDB from 1998 to 2011 were identified with multivariable logistic regression. Survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods. RESULTS: Surgery was used in 42.9\% (2057 of 4799) of cT2N0 patients. Of 1599 esophagectomy patients for whom treatment timing was recorded, induction therapy was used in 44.1\% (688). Pretreatment staging was proven accurate in only 26.7\% of patients (210 of 786) who underwent initial surgery without induction treatment and had complete pathologic data available: 41.6\% (n = 327) were upstaged and 31.7\% (n = 249) were downstaged. Adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy or radiation therapy) was given to 50.2\% of patients treated initially with surgery who were found after resection to have nodal disease. There was no significant difference in long-term survival between strategies of primary surgery and induction therapy followed by surgery (median 41.1 versus 41.9 months, p = 0.51). In multivariable analysis, induction therapy was not independently associated with risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16, p = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical staging for early-stage esophageal cancer is highly inaccurate, with only a quarter of surgically resected cT2N0 patients found to have had accurate pretreatment staging. Induction therapy for patients with cT2N0 esophageal cancer in the NCDB is not associated with improved survival.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Social determinants of health affect diagnosis and delivery of care to patients with esophageal cancer. This study hypothesized that hospital safety-net burden affects presentation, treatment, and outcomes in patients with esophageal cancer. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with esophageal cancer (2004 to 2013). Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival using {$\chi$}2 analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and multivariable modeling. RESULTS: There were 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95\% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p~= 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p~= 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Further analysis of unadjusted variables such as performance status, completion of therapy, and continuity of care, and others should be undertaken among safety-net hospitals with the goal of creating appropriate clinical pathways for care of esophageal cancer in vulnerable populations.},

  abstract = {Background Esophageal cancer remains a disease with poor survival and many complications. Measuring muscle mass and quality can identify patients with diminished muscle mass (sarcopenia) and muscle fat infiltration (myosteatosis). We studied the impact of sarcopenia and myosteatosis in resectable esophageal cancer on overall survival and complications. Patients and methods 139 patients received a radical esophagectomy. Skeletal muscle area (SMA) and muscle attenuation (MA) in CT images at L3 level were recorded and groups with and without sarcopenia and myosteatosis were compared for overall survival (OS), perioperative mortality, conduit complications, pleuropulmonary complications, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and other significant complications. Results Prevalence of sarcopenia and myosteatosis at presentation was 16.5\% and 51.8\%, respectively. Both were associated with decreased OS. Median survival was 18.3 months (CI 5.4\textendash 31.1) vs 31.0 months (CI 7.4\textendash 54.6) for sarcopenia/no sarcopenia (log rank p = 0.042) and 19.0 months (CI 13.3\textendash 24.7) vs 57.1 months (CI 15.2\textendash 99.0) for myosteatosis (log rank p = 0.044), respectively. A relationship between sarcopenia and myosteatosis and other negative outcomes after esophagectomy could not be established. Conclusions Sarcopenia and myosteatosis before esophagectomy are associated with decreased overall survival but not with more frequent perioperative complications. Identification of patients at risk can guide therapeutic decisions and interventions aimed at replenishing muscle reserves.},

This article is reporting long-term results of this phase III study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced adenocarcinomas of the oesophagogastric junction (Siewert types I-III) were eligible. Randomisation was done to chemotherapy (group A) or induction chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy (CRT; group B) followed by surgery. RESULTS: The primary end-point of the study was overall survival at 3 years. The study was closed early after 119 patients having been randomised and were eligible. Local progression-free survival after tumour resection was significantly improved by CRT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.37; 0.16-0.85, p~=~value 0.01) and 20 versus 12 patients were free of local tumour progression at 5 years (p~=~0.03). Although the rate of postoperative in-hospital mortality was somewhat higher with CRT (10.2\% versus 3.8\%, p~=~0.26), more patients were alive at 3 and 5 years after CRT (46.7\% and 39.5\%) compared with chemotherapy (26.1\% and 24.4\%). Thus, overall survival showed a trend in favour of preoperative CRT (HR 0.65, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-1.01, p~=~0.055). CONCLUSION: Although the primary end-point overall survival of the study was not met, our long-term follow-up data suggest a benefit in local progression-free survival when radiotherapy was added to preoperative chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction.},

The value of adding surgery to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were randomly allocated to either induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (40 Gy) followed by surgery (arm A), or the same induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy (at least 65 Gy) without surgery (arm B). Primary outcome was overall survival time. RESULTS: The median observation time was 6 years. The analysis of 172 eligible, randomized patients (86 patients per arm) showed overall survival to be equivalent between the two treatment groups (log-rank test for equivalence, P {$<$} .05). Local progression-free survival was better in the surgery group (2-year progression-free survival, 64.3\%; 95\% CI, 52.1\% to 76.5\%) than in the chemoradiotherapy group (2-year progression-free survival, 40.7\%; 95\% CI, 28.9\% to 52.5\%; hazard ratio [HR] for arm B v arm A, 2.1; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 3.5; P = .003). Treatment-related mortality was significantly increased in the surgery group than in the chemoradiotherapy group (12.8\% v 3.5\%, respectively; P = .03). Cox regression analysis revealed clinical tumor response to induction chemotherapy to be the single independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.19 to 0.47; P {$<$} .0001). CONCLUSION: Adding surgery to chemoradiotherapy improves local tumor control but does not increase survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal SCC.

Adding radiation therapy to preoperative chemotherapy appears promising, but its definitive value remains unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with locally advanced (uT3-4NXM0) adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus or gastric cardia were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: induction chemotherapy (15 weeks) followed by surgery (arm A); or chemotherapy (12 weeks) followed by chemoradiotherapy (3 weeks) followed by surgery (arm B). Primary outcome was overall survival time. A total of 354 patients were needed to detect a 10\% increase in 3-year survival from 25\% to 35\% by addition of radiation therapy. The study was prematurely closed due to low accrual. RESULTS: The median observation time was 46 months. A total of 126 patients were randomly assigned and 119 eligible patients were evaluated. The number of patients undergoing complete tumor resection was not different between treatment groups (69.5\% v 71.5\%). Patients in arm B had a significant higher probability of showing pathologic complete response (15.6\% v 2.0\%) or tumor-free lymph nodes (64.4\% v 37.7\%) at resection. Preoperative radiation therapy improved 3-year survival rate from 27.7\% to 47.4\% (log-rank P = .07, hazard ratio adjusted for randomization strata variables 0.67, 95\% CI, 0.41 to 1.07). Postoperative mortality was nonsignificantly increased in the chemoradiotherapy group (10.2\% v 3.8\%; P = .26).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The modified frailty index (mFI-11) is a NSQIP-based 11-factor index that has been proven to adequately reflect frailty and predict mortality and morbidity. These 11 factors, made of 16 variables, map to the original 70-item Canada Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index. In past years, certain NSQIP variables have been removed from the database; as of 2015, only 5 of the original 11 factors remained. The predictive power and usefulness of these 5 factors in an index (mFI-5) have not been proven in past literature. The goal of our study was to compare the mFI-5 to the mFI-11 in terms of value and predictive ability for mortality, postoperative infection, and unplanned 30-day readmission. STUDY DESIGN: The mFI was calculated by dividing the number of factors present for a patient by the number of available factors for which there were no missing data. Spearman's rho was used to assess correlation between the mFI-5 and mFI-11. Predictive models, using both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regressions, were created for each outcome for 9 surgical subspecialties using 2012 NSQIP data, the last year all mFI-11 variables existed. RESULTS: Correlation between the mFI-5 and mFI-11 was above 0.9 across all surgical specialties except for cardiac and vascular surgery. Adjusted and unadjusted models showed similar c-statistics for mFI-5 and mFI-11, and strong predictive ability for mortality and postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: The mFI-5 and the mFI-11 are equally effective predictors in all sub-specialties and the mFI5 is a strong predictor of mortality and postoperative complications. It has credibility for future use to study frailty within the NSQIP database. It also has potential in other databases and for clinical use.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) who are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy [BMT]) experience frequent relapses. In a large cohort, we assessed the timing, frequency, and types of relapses during an aggressive surveillance program and the value of the salvage strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with EC (N = 276) who received BMT were analyzed. Patients who had surgery within 6 months of chemoradiotherapy were excluded to reduce bias. We focused on local relapse (LR) and distant metastases (DM) and the salvage treatment of patients with LR only. Standard statistical methods were applied. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (95\% CI, 48.4 to 62.4). First relapses included LR only in 23.2\% (n = 64), DM with or without LR in 43.5\% (n = 120), and no relapses in 33.3\% (n = 92) of patients. Final relapses included no relapses in 33.3\%, LR only in 14.5\%, DM only in 15.9\%, and DM plus LR in 36.2\% of patients. Ninety-one percent of LRs occurred within 2 years and 98\% occurred within 3 years of BMT. Twenty-three (36\%) of 64 patients with LR only underwent salvage surgery, and their median overall survival was 58.6 months (95\% CI, 28.8 to not reached) compared with those patients with LR only who were unable to undergo surgery (9.5 months; 95\% CI, 7.8 to 13.3). CONCLUSION: Unlike in patients undergoing trimodality therapy, for whom surveillance/salvage treatment plays a lesser role,(1) in the BMT population, approximately 8\% of all patients (or 36\% of patients with LR only) with LRs occurring more than 6 months after chemoradiotherapy can undergo salvage treatment, and their survival is excellent. Our data support vigilant surveillance, at least in the first 24 months after chemotherapy, in these patients.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The primary purpose of surveillance of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and/or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma after local therapy (eg, chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery or trimodality therapy [TMT]) is to implement a potentially beneficial salvage therapy to overcome possible morbidity/mortality caused by locoregional failure (LRF). However, the benefits of surveillance are not well understood. We report on LRFs and salvage strategies in a large cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2010, 518 patients with EAC who completed TMT were analyzed for the frequency of LRF over time and salvage therapy outcomes. Standard statistical techniques were used. RESULTS: For 518 patients, the median follow-up time was 29.3 months (range, 1 to 149 months). Distant metastases (with or without LRF) occurred in 188 patients (36\%), and LRF only occurred in 27 patients (5\%). Eleven of 27 patients had lumen-only LRF. Most LRFs (89\%) occurred within 36 months of surgery. Twelve patients had salvage chemoradiotherapy, but only five survived more than 2 years. Four patients needed salvage surgery, and three who survived more than 2 years developed distant metastases. The median overall survival of 27 patients with LRF was 17 months, and 10 patients (37\%) survived more than 2 years. Thus, only 2\% of all 518 patients benefited from surveillance/salvage strategies. CONCLUSION: Our surveillance strategy, which is representative of many others currently being used, raises doubts about its effectiveness and benefits (along with concerns regarding types and times of studies and costs implications) to patients with EAC who have LRF only after TMT. Fortunately, LRFs are rare after TMT, but the salvage strategies are not highly beneficial. Our data can help develop an evidence-based surveillance strategy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessment of preoperative physiological status is crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for esophageal carcinoma (EC). We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of pulmonary dysfunctions and their relationships with other physiological factors, especially sarcopenia, in EC patients receiving esophagectomy. METHODS: In total, 411 EC patients who underwent esophagectomy between 2006 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative pulmonary functions were evaluated based on \%vital capacity (\%VC) and forced expiratory volume (FEV) 1.0\%. The thresholds were set as the lowest quartile (99\% for \%VC and 68.6\% for FEV1.0\%) in this cohort. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients (24.8\%) had low \%VC (\%VC\,{$<$}\,99\%), which was significantly associated with age, comorbidity, sarcopenia and postoperative complications, while not correlating with pathological variables. The overall survival (OS) of patients in the low \%VC group was significantly poorer than that of those in the high \%VC group (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), especially in those with pStage 0-II diseases (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). In contrast, survival was not stratified by FEV1.0\% (P\,=\,0.80). Notably, patients with both low \%VC and sarcopenia showed very poor 5-year OS (30.3\%). Multivariate analysis revealed low \%VC to be independently associated with poor OS (P\,=\,0.03). In the cause-specific survival analyses, low \%VC was an independent predictor of deaths from non-EC-related causes (P\,=\,0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative low \%VC was independently associated with poor survival outcomes, especially when present in combination with sarcopenia, due to an increased risk of death from non-EC-related causes. Preoperative spirometry testing is useful for predicting long-term outcomes in EC patients undergoing esophagectomy.},

Muscle loss during chemotherapy was defined as a {$\geq$}10\% reduction in the skeletal muscle index and was evaluated for its association with time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS). Results: Of 118 patients, 89\% had baseline sarcopenia and 31\% developed muscle loss. Muscle loss was significantly associated with shorter TTF and OS and was an independent prognostic factor for both these parameters; poor performance status and poorer differentiation on histology were also significant predictors of shorter OS.

Multiple statistical methods were used to analyze outcomes. RESULTS: Most patients were men and most had stage III or IV cancer. Five patients were surgery eligible but declined to have surgery. The median follow-up time was 33.9 months (95\% CI 18.3-49.6). The median survival time (MST) for 66 patients was only 14.5 months (95\% CI 10.8-19.7) and the median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 5.03 months (95\% CI 4.67-6.40).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer has been extensively studied, but no trial has unequivocally demonstrated improved overall survival with radiotherapy, despite a reduction in the rate of local recurrence. METHODS: Between March 1987 and February 1990, we randomly assigned 1168 patients younger than 80 years of age who had resectable rectal cancer to undergo preoperative irradiation (25 Gy delivered in five fractions in one week) followed by surgery within one week or to have surgery alone. RESULTS: The irradiation did not increase postoperative mortality. After five years of follow-up, the rate of local recurrence was 11 percent (63 of 553 patients) in the group that received radiotherapy before surgery and 27 percent (150 of 557) in the group treated with surgery alone (P{$<$}0.001). This difference was found in all subgroups defined according to Dukes' stage. The overall five-year survival rate was 58 percent in the radiotherapy-plus-surgery group and 48 percent in the surgery-alone group (P=0.004). The cancer-specific survival rates at nine years among patients treated with curative resection were 74 percent and 65 percent, respectively (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: A short-term regimen of high-dose preoperative radiotherapy reduces rates of local recurrence and improves survival among patients with resectable rectal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the utility of positron emission tomography (PET), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and computed tomographic (CT) scans to predict pathologic response and survival following preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) in esophageal cancer. METHODS: One hundred three sequential patients with locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer, who were treated with CRT and esophageal resection between May 2001 and November 2003 at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, were retrospectively reviewed. PET, EUS, and CT were performed before (pre) or after (post) CRT and before surgical resection. PET standardized uptake value (SUV) was defined as maximal uptake in primary tumor. RESULTS: Most patients were male (91 [88\%]) with adenocarcinoma (90 [87\%]). Pretreatment clinical stages were: IIA (42 [41\%]), IIB (5 [5\%]), III (50 [49\%]), and IVA (6 [6\%]). At the time of surgery, 58 patients (56\%) had a pathologic response to CRT ({$<$} or =10\% viable cells). Post-CRT measurements that correlated with pathologic response were: CT esophageal wall thickness (13.3 vs 15.3 mm, p = 0.04), EUS mass size (0.7 vs 1.7 cm, p = 0.01) and PET SUV (3.1 vs 5.8, p = 0.01). Post-CRT PET SUV equal to or greater than 4 had the highest accuracy for pathologic response (76\%). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that a post-CRT PET SUV equal to or greater than 4 was an independent predictor of survival (HR, 3.5, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The FDG-PET SUV is the most accurate noninvasive test to predict long-term survival after preoperative CRT and before surgical resection. Post-CRT FDG-PET cannot, however, rule out residual microscopic disease so esophagectomy should remain a therapeutic option even if the post-CRT imaging modalities are normal.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Some patients and oncologists choose to treat localized esophageal cancer with definitive chemotherapy and radiation therapy rather than surgery. A subset of these patients have local relapse without distant metastases and therefore have no other curative intent treatment option but salvage esophagectomy. METHODS: We reviewed our experience with salvage esophagectomy from 1987 to 2000 at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (n = 13, salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group) and compared the data with those of patients receiving esophagectomy in a planned fashion 4 to 6 weeks after preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy (n = 99, preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group). RESULTS: Increases in morbidity were seen after resection in the salvage after chemotherapy and radiotherapy group relative to the preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy group: mechanical ventilation (9.0 days vs 3.3 days, P =.08), intensive care unit stay (11.2 days vs 5.1 days, P =.07), hospital stay (29.4 days vs 18.4 days, P =.03), and anastomotic leak rates (5/13 [39\%] vs 7/99 [7\%], P =.005). Operative mortality (within 30 days) also tended to be increased statistically nonsignificantly (2/13 [15\%] vs 6/99 [6\%], P =.2). Salvage esophagectomy resulted in long-term survival (25\% 5-year survival) in a subset of patients. Improved survival after salvage esophagectomy was associated with early pathologic stage (T1 N0, T2 N0), prolonged time to relapse, and R0 surgical resection. CONCLUSION: Patients who undergo salvage esophagectomy for relapse of tumor after definitive chemoradiation therapy have increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital use relative to patients undergoing planned esophagectomy after preoperative chemoradiation. Nevertheless, long-term survival can be achieved in this group, and such treatment should be considered for carefully selected patients at an experienced center.},

METHODS: The exposure in this study of patients age 18-80 with one of nine non-advanced stage GI cancers in the 2007-2015 SEER database was a census tract-level SES composite. Multivariable models assessed associations of SES with use of surgery. Causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the proportion of survival disparities in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 that were mediated by disparities in use of surgery. RESULTS: Lowest SES quintile patients underwent surgery at significantly lower rates than highest quintile patients in each cancer. SES-based disparities in use of surgery were large and graded in esophagus adenocarcinoma, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Smaller but clinically relevant disparities were present in stomach, ampulla, and small bowel adenocarcinoma, whereas disparities were small in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Five-year all-stage overall survival (OS) was correlated with the size of disparities in use of surgery in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 (r\,=\,-\,0.87; p\,=\,0.003). Mean OS was significantly longer (range 3.5-8.9~months) in SES quintile 5 versus 1. Approximately one third of SES-based survival disparities in poor prognosis GI cancers were mediated by disparities in use of surgery. The size of disparities in use of surgery in SES quintiles 1 versus 5 was correlated with the proportion mediated (r\,=\,0.98; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Low SES patients with poor prognosis GI cancers are at substantial risk of undertreatment. Disparities in use of surgery contribute to diminished survival.},

No studies have been conducted regarding EN in patients after thoracoscopic esophagectomy as a less invasive surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of EN after thoracoscopic esophagectomy. METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer were divided into two groups: parenteral nutrition (PN; n = 25) and EN (n = 25). The rate of weight loss at postoperative day (POD) 14, levels of prealbumin at POD 10, postoperative complications until POD 14, and other perioperative data were collected for each group. RESULTS: This study analyzed data for 47 patients. The rate of weight loss at POD 14 was significantly lower in the EN group (3.0 {$\pm$} 3.2 \%) than in the PN group (5.1 {$\pm$} 3.7 \%; p = 0.020). Prealbumin levels were 21.0 {$\pm$} 7.5 mg/dL in the PN group and 18.4 {$\pm$} 5.8 mg/dL in the EN group at POD 10, with no significant differences between the groups. However, the incidence of postoperative pneumonia was higher in the PN group (30.4 \%) than in the EN group (12.5 \%). CONCLUSIONS: EN could suppress weight loss and reduce the incidence of pneumonia after thoracoscopic esophagectomy.},

  abstract = {Current algorithms for surveillance of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) after chemoradiation and surgery (trimodality therapy [TMT]) remain empiric. The authors hypothesized that the frequency, type, and timing of relapses after TMT would be highly associated with surgical pathology stage (SPS), and therefore SPS could be used to individualize the surveillance strategy. Between 2000 and 2010, 518 patients with EAC were identified who underwent TMT at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and were frequently surveyed. Frequency, type, and timing of the first relapse (locoregional and/or distant) were tabulated according to SPS. Standard statistical approaches were used. The median follow-up time after esophageal surgery was 55.4 months (range, 1.0-149.2 months). Disease relapse occurred in 215 patients (41.5\%). Higher SPS was associated with a higher rate of relapse (0/I vs II/III, P{$\leq$}.001; 0/I vs II, P=.002; SPS 0/I vs III, P{$\leq$}.001; and SPS II vs III, P=.005) and with shorter time to relapse (P{$<$}.001). Irrespective of the SPS, approximately 95\% of all relapses occurred within 36 months of surgery. The 3- and 5-year overall survival rates were shorter for patients with a higher SPS than those with a lower SPS (0/I vs II/III, P{$\leq$}.001; 0/I vs II, P{$\leq$}.001; 0/I vs III, P{$\leq$}.001; and II vs III, P=.014). The compelling data show an excellent association between SPS and frequency/type/timing of relapses after TMT in patients with EAC. Thus, the surveillance strategy can potentially be customized based on SPS. These data can inform a future evidence-based surveillance strategy that can be efficient and cost-effective.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For patients with localized esophageal cancer (EC) who can withstand surgery, the preferred therapy is chemoradiation followed by surgery (trimodality). However, after achieving a clinical complete response [clinCR; defined as both post-chemoradiation endoscopic biopsy showing no cancer and physiologic uptake by positron emission tomography (PET)], some patients decline surgery. The literature on the outcome of such patients is sparse. METHOD: Between 2002 and 2011, we identified 622 trimodality-eligible EC patients in our prospectively maintained databases. All patients had to be trimodality eligible and must have completed preoperative staging after chemoradiation that included repeat endoscopic biopsy and PET among other routine tests. RESULTS: Out of 622 trimodality-eligible patients identified, 61 patients (9.8\%) declined surgery. All 61 patients had a clinCR. The median age was 69 years (range 47-85). Males (85.2\%) and Caucasians (88.5\%) were dominant. Baseline stage was II (44.2\%) or III (52.5\%), and histology was adenocarcinoma (65.6\%) or squamous cell carcinoma (29.5\%). Forty-two patients are alive at a median follow-up of 50.9 months (95\% CI 39.5-62.3). The 5-year overall and relapse-free survival rates were 58.1 {$\pm$} 8.4 and 35.3 {$\pm$} 7.6\%, respectively. Of 13 patients with local recurrence during surveillance, 12 had successful salvage resection. CONCLUSION: Although the outcome of 61 EC patients with clinCR who declined surgery appears reasonable, in the absence of a validated prediction/prognosis model, surgery must be encouraged for all trimodality-eligible patients.},

Some patients, however, decline surgery after preoperative chemoradiation. The question of which patient should have esophagectomy and which one should not is unlikely to be answered by a prospective comparison; therefore, we matched the clinical covariates of several patients who had surgery with those who declined surgery (DS). METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, we identified 623 patients in our databases. Of 623 patients, 244 patients had TMT and 61 TMT-eligible patients were in the DS group. Using the propensity-score method, we matched 16 covariates between 36 DS patients and 36 TMT patients. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics between the two groups were balanced (p = NS). The median overall survival times were: 57.9 months (95\% CI: 27.7 to not applicable, NA) for the DS group and 50.8 months (95\% CI: 30.7 to NA) for the TMT group (p = 0.28). The median relapse-free survival times were: 18.5 (95\% CI: 11.5-30.4) for the DS group and 26.5 months (95\% CI: 15.5-NA) for the TMT group (p = 0.45). Eleven (31\%) of 36 patients in the DS group had salvage surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are intriguing but skewed by the patients who had salvage surgery in the DS group. Until highly reliable predictive models are developed for esophageal preservation, TMT must be encouraged for all TMT-eligible gastroesophageal cancer patients.},

  year = {2015},
  pages = {6},
  abstract = {Background: Patients with potentially curative oesophago-gastric cancer typically undergo neo-adjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery. The majority of anti-cancer drugs have a narrow therapeutic index. The aim of this study was to determine if features of body composition, assessed using computed tomography (CT) scans, may be predictive of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for oesophago-gastric cancer. The influence of sarcopenia and DLT on overall survival was also evaluated. Methods: 89 Patients having potentially curative oesophago-gastric cancer surgery were studied. Patients studied had histologically confirmed oesophago-gastric cancer with no evidence of distant metastasis on pre-operative staging. CT scan was performed in all cases at diagnosis. DLT was defined as toxicity leading to postponement of treatment, a drug dose reduction or definitive interruption of drug administration. Results: DLT occurred in 37 out of 89 patients (41.6\%) undergoing chemotherapy. Sarcopenia (odds ratio, 2.95; 95\% confidence interval, 1.23e7.09; p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.015) was associated with DLT on multivariate analysis. Median overall survival for patients who were sarcopenic was 569 days (IQ range: 357e1230 days) vs. 1013 days (IQ range: 496e1318 days) for patients who were not sarcopenic ( p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.04). There was no significant difference in overall survival in patients who experienced DLT compared with those that did not ( p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.665). Conclusions: Sarcopenia is a significant predictor of DLT in oesophago-gastric cancer patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. These results raise the potential for use of assessment of skeletal muscle mass using CT scans to predict toxicity and individualize chemotherapy dosing.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The average weight-losing pancreatic cancer patient undergoing palliative therapy is frequently overweight rather than underweight, and this can confound conventional measures used for risk stratification. The aim of this study was to evaluate if weight and body composition, specifically sarcopenia, assessed from diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans, is of prognostic value in patients with pancreatic cancer. The nature and extent of tissue loss over subsequent months was also evaluated. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 111 patients entering a palliative therapy program, who had CT images and had undergone nutritional screening, were studied. In patients for whom follow-up scans were available (n = 44), longitudinal changes in body composition were studied at a mean of 230 +/- 62 and 95 +/- 60 days prior to demise. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients (55.9\%) were sarcopenic, 44 (39.6\%) were overweight/obese, and 18 (16.2\%) were both. Age {$>$} or =59 years (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95\% confidence interval, 1.10-2.66; P = 0.018), and overweight/obese sarcopenia (hazard ratio, 2.07; 95\% confidence interval, 1.23-3.50; P = 0.006) were identified as independent predictors of survival on multivariate analysis. Longitudinal analysis revealed that total fat-free mass index decreased from 15.5 +/- 2.5 kg/m(2) to 14.5 +/- 2.0 kg/m2 (P = 0.002), and total fat mass index decreased from 7.5 +/- 2.0kg/m2 to 6.0 +/- 1.5kg/m2 (P {$<$} 0.0001) over 135 days. CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia in overweight/obese patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is an occult condition but can be identified using CT scans. This condition is an independent adverse prognostic indicator that should be considered for stratification of patients' entering clinical trials, systemic therapy, or support care programs.},

  abstract = {Para-aortic lymph node (PALN) recurrence is often seen in patients with lower thoracic esophageal cancer treated by esophagectomy with extended lymph node dissection. However, the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with PALN metastasis and the significance of PALN dissection are unknown. A total of 283 patients with lower thoracic esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy at our hospital between April 1984 and March 2007. Among these 283 patients, 60 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study according to following criteria: (i) clinical T2 to T4 tumor, (ii) no clinical PALN metastasis, and (iii) received PALN dissection. PALN dissection was indicated by a tumor depth of at least T2 and no severe complications. The clinicopathological data, recurrence pattern, and overall survival were compared between patients with PALN and without PALN metastasis. The mean length of surgery was 587 min and the mean blood loss was 1383 mL. The morbidity was 33.3\% and mortality was 5\% in this series. Sixteen patients (26.7\%) had PALN metastasis; these showed significantly more lymph node metastases (15.8 {$\pm$} 13.2 vs. 3.0 {$\pm$} 3.2, P {$<$} 0.0001) and significantly worse survival rates (53.3\% vs. 79.9\% at 1 year, 6.7\% vs. 62.0\% at 3 years, P {$<$} 0.0001) than patients without PALN metastasis. The incidence of lymph node recurrence (P {$<$} 0.0001) and hematogenous recurrence (P= 0.0487) was also higher in patients with PALN metastasis than in patients without PALN metastasis. Among the 16 patients with PALN metastasis, a univariate analysis revealed total number of metastatic nodes {$<$} 8 (P= 0.0325) to be a significant prognostic factor. A multivariate logistic regression analysis of the regional lymph nodes identified the invasion of the lower mediastinal nodes (hazard ratio = 6.120) and retroperitoneal nodes (hazard ratio = 15.167) to be significantly correlated with PALN metastasis. PALN metastasis is suggested to be related to the systemic spread of lymphatic metastasis even in lower thoracic esophageal cancer. PALN dissection for pathological PALN(+) patients should not be performed. It remains to be determined in future prospective studies whether patients without pathological PALN metastasis, but showing PALN micrometastasis, could achieve improved survival with PALN dissection.},

This follow-up study of 374 patients with rectal cancer reports the relationship between preoperative MRI assessment of CRM staging, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM stage, and clinical variables with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and time to local recurrence (LR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients underwent protocol high-resolution pelvic MRI. Tumor distance to the mesorectal fascia of {$\leq$} 1 mm was recorded as an MRI-involved CRM. A Cox proportional hazards model was used in multivariate analysis to determine the relationship of MRI assessment of CRM to survivorship after adjusting for preoperative covariates. RESULTS: Surviving patients were followed for a median of 62 months. The 5-year OS was 62.2\% in patients with MRI-clear CRM compared with 42.2\% in patients with MRI-involved CRM with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.97 (95\% CI, 1.27 to 3.04; P {$<$} .01). The 5-year DFS was 67.2\% (95\% CI, 61.4\% to 73\%) for MRI-clear CRM compared with 47.3\% (95\% CI, 33.7\% to 60.9\%) for MRI-involved CRM with an HR of 1.65 (95\% CI, 1.01 to 2.69; P {$<$} .05). Local recurrence HR for MRI-involved CRM was 3.50 (95\% CI, 1.53 to 8.00; P {$<$} .05). MRI-involved CRM was the only preoperative staging parameter that remained significant for OS, DFS, and LR on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: High-resolution MRI preoperative assessment of CRM status is superior to AJCC TNM-based criteria for assessing risk of LR, DFS, and OS. Furthermore, MRI CRM involvement is significantly associated with distant metastatic disease; therefore, colorectal cancer teams could intensify treatment and follow-up accordingly to improve survival outcomes.},

Multiple software programs are available, but little work has been done comparing programs. We aimed to determine if CT-derived measures of skeletal muscle CSA at the level of the L3 are influenced by the software program used. We also demonstrate the importance of the ImageJ corrigendum published in this journal. METHODS: Two software programs, National Institutes of Health ImageJ and Tomovision sliceOmatic, were compared. ImageJ measures were obtained using both the original tutorial and corrigendum instructions. Skeletal muscle CSA at the level of the L3 was measured in advanced heart failure and head and neck cancer populations by 3 different investigators. Intraclass correlation coefficients were used to calculate intrarater and interrater reliability. Bland-Altman analysis was used to assess agreement. RESULTS: Both software programs yielded excellent intrarater and interrater reliability scores (intraclass correlation coefficients, 0.985-1.000). The overall mean difference (ImageJ tutorial with corrigendum - sliceOmatic) for the entire sample (N = 51) was found to be 1.53 cm2 (95\% CI, 0.59-2.47 cm2 ). The overall mean difference (ImageJ corrected - original) for the entire sample (N = 51) was found to be -11.35 cm2 (95\% CI, -12.75 to -9.95 cm2 ). CONCLUSION: Measures of skeletal muscle CSA at the L3 were found to be {$\sim$}1.53 cm2 higher with ImageJ than sliceOmatic. This difference was not found to affect interpretation against a published cut point. The importance of accounting for the ImageJ tutorial corrigendum was shown to be clinically significant when applied to published cut points.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For endoscopic resection of early GI neoplasia, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) achieves higher rates of complete resection (R0) than endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). However, ESD is technically more difficult and evidence from randomised trial is missing. OBJECTIVE: We compared the efficacy and safety of ESD and EMR in patients with neoplastic Barrett's oesophagus (BO). DESIGN: BO patients with a focal lesion of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or early adenocarcinoma (EAC) {$\leq$}3\hspace{0.25em}cm were randomised to either ESD or EMR. Primary outcome was R0 resection; secondary outcomes were complete remission from neoplasia, recurrences and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in patient and lesion characteristics between the groups randomised to ESD (n=20) or EMR (n=20). Histology of the resected specimen showed HGIN or EAC in all but six cases. Although R0 resection defined as margins free of HGIN/EAC was achieved more frequently with ESD (10/17 vs 2/17, p=0.01), there was no difference in complete remission from neoplasia at 3\hspace{0.25em}months (ESD 15/16 vs EMR 16/17, p=1.0). During a mean follow-up period of 23.1{$\pm$}6.4\hspace{0.25em}months, recurrent EAC was observed in one case in the ESD group. Elective surgery was performed in four and three cases after ESD and EMR, respectively (p=1.0). Two severe AEs were recorded for ESD and none for EMR (p=0.49). CONCLUSIONS: In terms of need for surgery, neoplasia remission and recurrence, ESD and EMR are both highly effective for endoscopic resection of early BO neoplasia. ESD achieves a higher R0 resection rate, but for most BO patients this bears little clinical relevance. ESD is, however, more time consuming and may cause severe AE.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromoendoscopy is traditionally used to identify inconspicuous Barrett's neoplasia and mark the boundaries before endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Trimodal imaging endoscopy is useful in identifying early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy (lateral and deep margin clearance) of trimodal imaging endoscopy-assisted EMR in early Barrett's neoplasia in a tertiary referral setting. METHODS: The entire Barrett's segment was visualized by high-resolution endoscopy followed by autofluorescence imaging, and suspicious areas were identified. Narrow band imaging and magnification was used to confirm the suspicious areas. The outer boundary of the lesion was then marked using the tip of a snare diathermy and EMR was performed using multiband mucosectomy technique by a single operator (KR). RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included: 13 patients had high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN); 3 patients had intramucosal carcinoma (IMC); (8 males, median age, 69.5 (range, 50-77) years with Barrett's esophagus (interquartile range (IQR), 2-5 cm; median length, 3 cm). All lesions were successfully identified, using trimodal imaging endoscopy. Overall EMR was complete in 14 of 16 (81.2\%) patients with early Barrett's neoplasia. Four of 16 patients (18\%; all with pre-EMR HGIN) were considered to have incomplete EMR (deep margins involved), but operative histology showed only Barrett's metaplasia in 2 (histological false positive) and IMC in 1. Thus, overall 14 of 16 (87.5\%) patients had complete EMR of the original lesions. In patients who did not undergo esophagectomy, there was no disease recurrence on endoscopic biopsies at a mean follow-up of 8 (IQR, 6-12) months. Three of the 16 patients (18.75\%) with post-EMR bleeding were successfully treated with APC/hemoclips. CONCLUSIONS: Trimodal imaging endoscopy is a feasible alternative to chromoendoscopy to identify inconspicuous neoplasia and assist EMR of early neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus.},

  abstract = {Progressive weight loss is a common feature of many types of cancer and is responsible not only for a poor quality of life and poor response to chemotherapy, but also a shorter survival time than is found in patients with comparable tumors without weight loss. Although anorexia is common, a decreased food intake alone is unable to account for the changes in body composition seen in cancer patients, and increasing nutrient intake is unable to reverse the wasting syndrome. Although energy expenditure is increased in some patients, cachexia can occur even with a normal energy expenditure. Various factors have been investigated as mediators of tissue wasting in cachexia. These include cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), as well as tumor-derived factors such as lipid mobilizing factor (LMF) and protein mobilizing factor (PMF), which can directly mobilize fatty acids and amino acids from adipose tissue and skeletal muscle respectively. Induction of lipolysis by the cytokines is thought to result from an inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), although clinical studies provide no evidence for an inhibition of LPL in the adipose tissue of cancer patients. Instead there is an increased expression of hormone sensitive lipase, the enzyme activated by LMF. Protein degradation in cachexia is associated with an increased activity of the ATP-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The biological activity of both the LMF and PMF was shown to be attenuated by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Clinical studies show that this polyunsaturated fatty acid is able to stabilize the rate of weight loss and adipose tissue and muscle mass in cachectic patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Knowledge of the mechanism of cancer cachexia should lead to the development of new therapeutic agents.},

AIMS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to determine whether survival differences among racial/ethnic patient populations persist after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. METHODS: Our study included T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. We compared survival among two racial/ethnic patient subgroups using Cox proportional hazards methods, adjusting for age, sex, histology, marital status, socioeconomics, SEER region, comorbidities, T stage, tumor location, diagnosis year, and treatment received. RESULTS: Among 2025 patients, 87.9\% were White and 12.1\% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7~months for Whites vs 13.8~months for Nonwhites (p\,=\,0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR\,=\,1.29, 95\% CI 1.11-1.49, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR\,=\,0.94, 95\% CI 0.80-1.10, p\,=\,0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors. In particular, associations were seen in surgery and T stage. Further research is needed to understand potential mechanisms underlying the differences and to better target patients who can benefit from treatment options.},

In this study, we analyzed the independent effects of race, gender, treatment, and socioeconomic status (SES) on overall survival (OS). METHODS: Data for all EC cases between 2004 and 2010 with follow-up through 2012 were obtained from the California Cancer Registry. We conducted descriptive analyses of clinical variables and survival analyses by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods. RESULTS: African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95\% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Our findings support further health disparities research for this disease.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Palliation of malignant esophageal obstruction is an important clinical problem. Expandable metal stents are a major advance in therapy, but many stents become obstructed because of tumor ingrowth. The aim of this study was to compare a new, membrane-covered expandable metal stent to conventional prostheses in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with malignant inoperable esophageal obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction participated in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to covered or uncovered stents. The principal outcome measure was the need for reintervention because of recurrent dysphagia or migration. Secondary endpoints were relief of dysphagia measured by a dysphagia score (grade 0 = no dysphagia, grade 1 = able to eat solid food, grade 2 = semisolids only, grade 3 = liquids only, grade 4 = complete dysphagia) and the rate of complications and functional status. All patients were observed at monthly intervals until death or for 6 months. RESULTS: One week after stenting the dysphagia score improved significantly in both the uncovered (n = 32, 3 +/- 0.1 to 1 +/- 0.1 [means +/- SEMs], p {$<$} 0.001) and covered (n = 30, 3 +/- 0.1 to 1 +/- 0.2 [means +/- SEMs], p {$<$} 0.001) stents. Obstructing tumor ingrowth was significantly more likely in the uncovered stent group (9/30) than in the covered group (1/32) (p = 0.005). Significant stent migration occurred in 2/30 patients with uncovered stents, as compared with 4/32 patients in the covered group (p = 0.44). Reinterventions for tumor ingrowth were significantly greater in the uncovered stent group (27\%), as compared with 0\% in the covered group (p = 0.002). Life table analysis showed similar survival in both groups. CONCLUSION: Membrane-covered stents have significantly better palliation than conventional bare metal stents because of decreased rates of tumor ingrowth that necessitate endoscopic reintervention for dysphagia.},

  abstract = {Our purpose was to prospectively investigate optimal evaluation of qualitative and quantitative 18F-FDG PET/CT in response evaluations 12-14 wk after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in esophageal cancer patients. Methods: This was a side study of the prospective diagnostic pre-SANO trial. 18F-FDG PET/CT scans at baseline and at 12-14 wk after nCRT were qualitatively assessed for the presence of tumor. Maximum SUVs normalized for lean body mass (SULmax) were measured in all scans. The primary endpoint was the proportion of false-negative patients with tumor regression grade (TRG) 3-4 ({$>$}10\% vital residual tumor) in qualitative and quantitative analyses. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis for TRG1 versus TRG3-4 using SULmax, SULmax tumor-to-esophagus ratio, and {$\Delta\%$}SULmax was performed to define optimal cutoffs. Secondary endpoints were sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value for TRG1 versus TRG2-4. Results: In total, 129 of 219 patients were analyzed. Qualitative 18F-FDG PET/CT was unable to detect TRG3-4 in 15\% of patients. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value in qualitative analysis for detecting TRG1 versus TRG2-4 was 80\%, 37\%, 42\%, and 77\%, respectively. In 18 of 190 patients (10\%) with follow-up scans after nCRT, 18F-FDG PET/CT identified new interval metastases. Quantitative parameters did not detect TRG3-4 tumor in 27\%-61\% of patients. The optimal cutoff for detecting TRG1 versus TRG2-4 was a post-nCRT SULmax of 2.93 (area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve, 0.70). Conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative analyses of 18F-FDG PET/CT are unable to accurately detect TRG3-4 and to discriminate substantial residual disease from benign inflammation-induced 18F-FDG uptake after nCRT. However, 18F-FDG PET/CT is useful for the detection of interval metastases and might become useful in an active surveillance strategy with serial 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning.},

We hypothesized that patients with esophageal cancer with {$>$}10\% weight loss during the 3 months before their diagnosis would be at an increased risk of postoperative complications, have a longer length of stay, and have worse overall survival. METHODS: In the present hospital-based cohort study, all patients who had undergone surgery for esophageal cancer in 1990 to 2010 at the Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam were included. Weight loss was defined as "no, or limited" ({$\leq$}10\%) or "severe" ({$>$}10\%). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the relative risk of complications, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Hazard ratios were calculated to assess the length of hospital stay and survival. The risk estimates were adjusted for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Of 922 included patients, 155 (17\%) had experienced severe weight loss. These patients had no increased risk of early surgical, early nonsurgical, or late surgical complications (OR, 0.83 and 95\% CI, 0.54-1.24; OR, 0.90 and 95\% CI, 0.63-1.30; OR, 1.14 and 95\% CI, 0.79-1.66, respectively) and had no increased length of stay (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.89-1.35).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is widely accepted as the standard of care for high-risk rectal cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy is advised in several international guidelines, although the survival benefit remains unclear and compliance is poor. The current multidisciplinary approach has led to major improvements in local control, yet the occurrence of distant metastases has not decreased accordingly. The combination of short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) and chemotherapy in the waiting period before surgery might have several benefits, including higher compliance, downstaging and better effect of systemic therapy. METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated, international multicentre randomized phase III trial. High-risk rectal cancer patients were randomized to SCRT followed by chemotherapy (6 cycles CAPOX or alternatively 9 cycles FOLFOX4) and subsequent surgery, or long-course radiotherapy (25-28~\texttimes ~2-1.8~Gy) with concomitant capecitabine followed by surgery and optional postoperative chemotherapy (8 cycles CAPOX or 12 cycles FOLFOX4) according to local institutions' policy. The primary endpoint is time to disease-related treatment failure. Here, we report the compliance, toxicity and postoperative complications in both study groups. FINDINGS: Between June 2011 and June 2016, 920 patients were enrolled. Of these, 901 were evaluable (460 in the experimental arm and 441 in the standard arm). All patients in the experimental arm received 5~\texttimes ~5 Gy radiotherapy, and 84\% of all patients received at least 75\% of the prescribed chemotherapy. In the standard arm, the compliance for CRT was 93\% and 58\% for postoperative chemotherapy. Toxicity {$\geq$}grade 3 occurred in 48\% of patients in the experimental arm, compared to 25\% of patients in the standard arm during preoperative treatment and 35\% of patients during postoperative chemotherapy. No statistically significant differences in surgical procedures or postoperative complications were observed. INTERPRETATION: High compliance (84\%) of preoperative systemic treatment could be achieved with the experimental approach. Although considerable toxicity was observed during preoperative therapy, this did not lead to differences in surgical procedures or postoperative complications. Longer follow-up time is needed to assess the primary endpoint and related outcomes.},

Both non-contrast and contrast CT scans are used to determine SMA and MRA. The effect of the use of a contrast agent on SMA and MRA is unknown. Therefore, we investigated agreement between these two scan options. SMA and MRA of 41 healthy individuals were analysed on a paired non-contrast and contrast single CT scan, and agreement between paired scan results was assessed with use of Bland-Altman plots, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), standard error of measurements (SEM) and smallest detectable differences at a 95\% confidence level (SDD95 ). Analyses were stratified by tube voltage. Difference in SMA between non-contrast and contrast scans made with a different tube voltage was 7{$\cdot$}0~{$\pm~$}7{$\cdot$}5~cm2 ; for scans made with the same tube voltage this was 2{$\cdot$}3~{$\pm~$}1{$\cdot$}7~cm2 . Agreement was excellent for both methods: ICC: 0{$\cdot$}952, SEM: 7{$\cdot$}2~cm2 , SDD95 : 19{$\cdot$}9~cm2 and ICC: 0{$\cdot$}997, SEM: 2{$\cdot$}0~cm2 , SDD95 : 5{$\cdot$}6~cm2 , respectively. MRA of scans made with a different tube voltage differed 1{$\cdot$}3~{$\pm~$}11{$\cdot$}3 HU, and agreement was poor (ICC: 0{$\cdot$}207, SEM: 7{$\cdot$}9 HU, SDD95 : 21{$\cdot$}8 HU). For scans made with the same tube voltage the difference was 6{$\cdot$}7~{$\pm~$}3{$\cdot$}2 HU, and agreement was good (ICC: 0{$\cdot$}682, SEM: 5{$\cdot$}3 HU, SDD95 : 14{$\cdot$}6 HU). In conclusion, SMA and MRA can be slightly influenced by the use of contrast agent. To minimise measurement error, image acquisition parameters of the scans should be similar.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active surveillance after neoadjuvant therapies has emerged among several malignancies. During active surveillance, frequent assessments are performed to detect residual disease and surgery is only reserved for those patients in whom residual disease is proven or highly suspected without distant metastases. After neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), nearly one-third of esophageal cancer patients achieve a pathologically complete response (pCR). Both patients that achieve a pCR and patients that harbor subclinical disseminated disease after nCRT could benefit from an active surveillance strategy. SUMMARY: Esophagectomy is still the cornerstone of treatment in patients with esophageal cancer. Non-surgical treatment via definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) is currently reserved only for patients not eligible for esophagectomy. Since salvage esophagectomy after dCRT (50-60 Gy) results in increased complications, morbidity and mortality compared to surgery after nCRT (41.4 Gy), the latter seems preferable in the setting of active surveillance. Clinical response evaluations can detect substantial (i.e., tumor regression grade [TRG] 3-4) tumors after nCRT with a sensitivity of 90\%, minimizing the risk of development of non-resectable recurrences. Current scarce and retrospective literature suggests that active surveillance following nCRT might not jeopardize overall survival and postponed surgery could be performed safely. Key Message: Before an active surveillance approach could be considered standard treatment, results of phase III randomized trials should be awaited.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The TME trial investigated the value of preoperative short-term radiotherapy in combination with total mesorectal excision (TME). Long-term results are reported after a median follow-up of 12 years. METHODS: Between Jan 12, 1996, and Dec 31, 1999, 1861 patients with resectable rectal cancer without evidence of distant disease were randomly assigned to TME preceded by 5 \texttimes{} 5 Gy radiotherapy or TME alone (ratio 1:1). Randomisation was based on permuted blocks of six with stratification according to centre and expected type of surgery. The primary endpoint was local recurrence, analysed for all eligible patients who underwent a macroscopically complete local resection. FINDINGS: 10-year cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 5\% in the group assigned to radiotherapy and surgery and 11\% in the surgery-alone group (p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). The effect of radiotherapy became stronger as the distance from the anal verge increased. However, when patients with a positive circumferential resection margin were excluded, the relation between distance from the anal verge and the effect of radiotherapy disappeared. Patients assigned to radiotherapy had a lower overall recurrence and when operated with a negative circumferential resection margin, cancer-specific survival was higher. Overall survival did not differ between groups. For patients with TNM stage III cancer with a negative circumferential resection margin, 10-year survival was 50\% in the preoperative radiotherapy group versus 40\% in the surgery-alone group (p=0{$\cdot$}032). INTERPRETATION: For all eligible patients, preoperative short-term radiotherapy reduced 10-year local recurrence by more than 50\% relative to surgery alone without an overall survival benefit. For patients with a negative resection margin, the effect of radiotherapy was irrespective of the distance from the anal verge and led to an improved cancer-specific survival, which was nullified by an increase in other causes of death, resulting in an equal overall survival. Nevertheless, preoperative short-term radiotherapy significantly improved 10-year survival in patients with a negative circumferential margin and TNM stage III. Future staging techniques should offer possibilities to select patient groups for which the balance between benefits and side-effects will result in sufficiently large gains.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of patients with esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer is not well established. We compared chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery with surgery alone in this patient population. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with resectable tumors to receive surgery alone or weekly administration of carboplatin (doses titrated to achieve an area under the curve of 2 mg per milliliter per minute) and paclitaxel (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) for 5 weeks and concurrent radiotherapy (41.4 Gy in 23 fractions, 5 days per week), followed by surgery. RESULTS: From March 2004 through December 2008, we enrolled 368 patients, 366 of whom were included in the analysis: 275 (75\%) had adenocarcinoma, 84 (23\%) had squamous-cell carcinoma, and 7 (2\%) had large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Of the 366 patients, 178 were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, and 188 to surgery alone. The most common major hematologic toxic effects in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group were leukopenia (6\%) and neutropenia (2\%); the most common major nonhematologic toxic effects were anorexia (5\%) and fatigue (3\%). Complete resection with no tumor within 1 mm of the resection margins (R0) was achieved in 92\% of patients in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 69\% in the surgery group (P{$<$}0.001). A pathological complete response was achieved in 47 of 161 patients (29\%) who underwent resection after chemoradiotherapy. Postoperative complications were similar in the two treatment groups, and in-hospital mortality was 4\% in both. Median overall survival was 49.4 months in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 24.0 months in the surgery group. Overall survival was significantly better in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group (hazard ratio, 0.657; 95\% confidence interval, 0.495 to 0.871; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improved survival among patients with potentially curable esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer. The regimen was associated with acceptable adverse-event rates. (Funded by the Dutch Cancer Foundation [KWF Kankerbestrijding]; Netherlands Trial Register number, NTR487.).},

  abstract = {A reliable prediction of a pathologic complete response (pathCR) to chemoradiotherapy before surgery for esophageal cancer would enable investigators to study the feasibility and outcome of an organ-preserving strategy after chemoradiotherapy. So far no clinical parameters or diagnostic studies are able to accurately predict which patients will achieve a pathCR. The aim of this study was to determine whether subjective and quantitative assessment of baseline and postchemoradiation (18)F-FDG PET can improve the accuracy of predicting pathCR to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer beyond clinical predictors. METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and the need for written informed consent was waived. Clinical parameters along with subjective and quantitative parameters from baseline and postchemoradiation (18)F-FDG PET were derived from 217 esophageal adenocarcinoma patients who underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. The associations between these parameters and pathCR were studied in univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Four prediction models were constructed and internally validated using bootstrapping to study the incremental predictive values of subjective assessment of (18)F-FDG PET, conventional quantitative metabolic features, and comprehensive (18)F-FDG PET texture/geometry features, respectively. The clinical benefit of (18)F-FDG PET was determined using decision-curve analysis. RESULTS: A pathCR was found in 59 (27\%) patients. A clinical prediction model (corrected c-index, 0.67) was improved by adding (18)F-FDG PET-based subjective assessment of response (corrected c-index, 0.72). This latter model was slightly improved by the addition of 1 conventional quantitative metabolic feature only (i.e., postchemoradiation total lesion glycolysis; corrected c-index, 0.73), and even more by subsequently adding 4 comprehensive (18)F-FDG PET texture/geometry features (corrected c-index, 0.77). However, at a decision threshold of 0.9 or higher, representing a clinically relevant predictive value for pathCR at which one may be willing to omit surgery, there was no clear incremental value. CONCLUSION: Subjective and quantitative assessment of (18)F-FDG PET provides statistical incremental value for predicting pathCR after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer. However, the discriminatory improvement beyond clinical predictors does not translate into a clinically relevant benefit that could change decision making.},

  abstract = {The aim of the study was to compare the diagnostic performance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in staging of oesophageal cancer. PubMed was searched to identify English-language articles published before January 2006 and reporting on diagnostic performance of EUS, CT, and/or FDG-PET in oesophageal cancer patients. Articles were included if absolute numbers of true-positive, false-negative, false-positive, and true-negative test results were available or derivable for regional, celiac, and abdominal lymph node metastases and/or distant metastases. Sensitivities and specificities were pooled using a random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to study potential effects of study and patient characteristics. Random effects pooled sensitivities of EUS, CT, and FDG-PET for regional lymph node metastases were 0.80 (95\% confidence interval 0.75-0.84), 0.50 (0.41-0.60), and 0.57 (0.43-0.70), respectively, and specificities were 0.70 (0.65-0.75), 0.83 (0.77-0.89), and 0.85 (0.76-0.95), respectively. Diagnostic performance did not differ significantly across these tests. For detection of celiac lymph node metastases by EUS, sensitivity and specificity were 0.85 (0.72-0.99) and 0.96 (0.92-1.00), respectively. For abdominal lymph node metastases by CT, these values were 0.42 (0.29-0.54) and 0.93 (0.86-1.00), respectively. For distant metastases, sensitivity and specificity were 0.71 (0.62-0.79) and 0.93 (0.89-0.97) for FDG-PET and 0.52 (0.33-0.71) and 0.91 (0.86-0.96) for CT, respectively. Diagnostic performance of FDG-PET for distant metastases was significantly higher than that of CT, which was not significantly affected by study and patient characteristics. The results suggest that EUS, CT, and FDG-PET each play a distinctive role in the detection of metastases in oesophageal cancer patients. For the detection of regional lymph node metastases, EUS is most sensitive, whereas CT and FDG-PET are more specific tests. For the evaluation of distant metastases, FDG-PET has probably a higher sensitivity than CT. Its combined use could however be of clinical value, with FDG-PET detecting possible metastases and CT confirming or excluding their presence and precisely determining the location(s).},

The gold standard for body composition analysis in cancer patients is computed tomography (CT). To date, the effect of contrast-enhancement on muscle composition measurements has not been established. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of contrast-enhancement on skeletal muscle mass and density measurements on four-phase CT studies. DESIGN: In this observational study, two observers measured cross-sectional skeletal muscle area corrected for patients' height (skeletal muscle index [SMI]) and density (SMD) at the level of the third lumbar vertebra on 50 randomly selected CT examinations with unenhanced, arterial, and portal-venous phases. The levels of agreement between enhancement phases for SMI and SMD were calculated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: Mean SMI was 42.5 ({$\pm$}9.9)~cm2/m2 on the unenhanced phase, compared with 42.8 ({$\pm$}9.9) and 43.6 ({$\pm$}9.9)~cm2/m2 for the arterial and portal-venous phase, respectively (both p~{$<~$}0.01). Mean SMD was lower for the unenhanced phase (30.9~{$\pm~$}8.0~Hounsfield units [HU]) compared with the arterial (38.0~{$\pm~$}9.9~HU) and portal-venous (38.7~{$\pm~$}9.2~HU) phase (both p~{$<~$}0.001). No significant difference was found between SMD in the portal-venous and arterial phase (p~=~0.161). The ICCs were excellent ({$\geq$}0.992) for all SMIs and for SMD between the contrast-enhanced phases (0.949). The ICCs for the unenhanced phase compared with the arterial (0.676) and portal-venous (0.665) phase were considered fair to good. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant differences in SMI were observed between different enhancement phases. However, further work is needed to assess the clinical relevance of these small differences. Contrast-enhancement strongly influenced SMD values. Studies using this measure should therefore use the portal-venous phase of contrast-enhanced CT examinations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Please see Appendix 4 for a glossary of terms.The outcome of patients with esophageal cancer is generally poor. Although multimodal therapy is standard, there is conflicting evidence regarding the addition of esophagectomy to chemoradiotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness and safety of chemoradiotherapy plus surgery with that of chemoradiotherapy alone in people with nonmetastatic esophageal carcinoma. SEARCH METHODS: We performed a computerized search for relevant studies, up to Feburary 2017, on the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases using MeSH headings and keywords. We searched five online databases of clinical trials, handsearched conference proceedings, and screened reference lists of retrieved papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemoradiotherapy plus esophagectomy with chemoradiotherapy alone for localized esophageal carcinoma. We excluded RCTs comparing chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone with esophagectomy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the quality of the evidence, using standardized Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), estimated with Hazard Ratio (HR). Secondary outcomes, estimated with risk ratio (RR), were local and distant progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QoL), treatment-related mortality and morbidity, and use of salvage procedures for dysphagia. Data were analyzed using a random effects model in Review Manager 5.3 software. MAIN RESULTS: From 2667 references, we identified two randomized studies, in six reports, that included 431 participants. All participants were clinically staged to have at least T3 and/or node positive thoracic esophageal carcinoma, 93\% of which was squamous cell histology. The risk of methodological bias of the included studies was low to moderate.High-quality evidence found the addition of esophagectomy had little or no difference on overall survival (HR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.79 to 1.24; P = 0.92; I{$^2$} = 0\%; two trials). Neither study reported PFS, therefore, freedom from loco-regional relapse was used as a proxy. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that the addition of esophagectomy probably improved freedom from locoregional relapse (HR 0.55, 95\% CI 0.39 to 0.76; P = 0.0004; I{$^2$} = 0\%; two trials), but low-quality evidence suggested it may increase the risk of treatment-related mortality (RR 5.11, 95\% CI 1.74 to 15.02; P = 0.003; I{$^2$} = 2\%; two trials).The other pre-specified outcomes (quality of life, treatment-related toxicity, and use of salvage procedures for dysphagia) were reported by only one study, which found very low-quality evidence that use of esophagectomy was associated with reduced short-term QoL (MD 0.93, 95\% CI 0.24 to 1.62), and low-quality evidence that it reduced use of salvage procedures for dysphagia (HR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.36 to 0.75). Neither study compared treatment-related morbidity between treatment groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, the addition of esophagectomy to chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, provides little or no difference on overall survival, and may be associated with higher treatment-related mortality. The addition of esophagectomy probably delays locoregional relapse, however, this end point was not well defined in the included studies. It is undetermined whether these results can be applied to the treatment of adenocarcinomas, tumors involving the distal esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction, and to people with poor response to chemoradiation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To examine the efficacy of the Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal carcinoma prior to the widespread use of preoperative chemotherapy and irradiation, we reviewed our experience. METHODS: We reexamined the cases of 220 consecutive patients who underwent an Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal cancer from January 1992 through December 1995. RESULTS: There were 196 men (89.1\%) and 24 women. Median age was 65 years (range, 29 to 85 years). The results of pathological study showed adenocarcinoma in 188 patients (85.5\%), squamous cell carcinoma in 31 (14.1\%), and leiomyosarcoma in 1 patient (0.5\%). Postsurgical staging was as follows: stage 0 in 10 patients, stage I in 19, stage IIa in 38, stage IIb in 28, stage III in 111, and stage IV in 14. The operative mortality rate was 1.4\% (3 patients), and complications occurred in 83 patients (37.7\%). Follow-up was 98.6\% complete. Median survival for operative survivors was 1.9 years (range, 32 days to 8.7 years). The overall 5-year survival rate was 25.2\%; it was 80\% for patients in stage 0, 94.4\% for those in stage I, 36.0\% for those in stage IIa, 14.3\% for patients in stage IIb, 10\% for those in stage III and 0\% for patients in stage IV. CONCLUSIONS: Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy for esophageal cancer is a safe operation. Long-term survival is stage dependent. The low survival associated with advanced cancers should stimulate the search for effective neoadjuvant therapy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standard therapy for loco-regionally advanced, resectable oesophageal carcinoma is trimodality therapy (TMT) consisting of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and oesophagectomy. Evidence of survival advantage of TMT over organ-preserving definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) is inconclusive. The aim of this study is to compare survival between TMT and dCRT. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies on resectable, curatively treated, oesophageal carcinoma patients above 18~years were included. Three online databases were searched for studies comparing TMT with dCRT. Primary outcomes were 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tools for RCTs and cohort studies. Quality of evidence was evaluated according to Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies described in 35 articles were included in this systematic review, and 33 were included in the meta-analyses. Two-, three- and five-year overall survival was significantly lower in dCRT compared to TMT, with relative risks (RRs) of 0.69 (95\% CI 0.57-0.83), 0.76 (95\% CI 0.63-0.92) and 0.57 (95\% CI 0.47-0.71), respectively. When only analysing studies with equal patient groups at baseline, no significant differences for 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival were found with RRs of 0.83 (95\% CI 0.62-1.10), 0.81 (95\% CI 0.57-1.14) and 0.63 (95\% CI 0.36-1.12). CONCLUSION: These meta-analyses do not show clear survival advantage for TMT over dCRT. Only a non-significant trend towards better survival was seen, assuming comparable patient groups at baseline. Non-operative management of oesophageal carcinoma patients might be part of a personalised and tailored treatment approach in future. However, to date hard evidence proving its non-inferiority compared to operative management is lacking.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Accurate staging of esophageal cancer (ECA) is critical in determining appropriate therapy. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning can be used, but limited data exists regarding the use of combined PET/CT fusion imaging and EUS in ECA staging. The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of integrated PET/CT imaging and EUS in the staging of ECA. PROCEDURES: Identification of patients diagnosed with ECA from 2004 to 2007 that underwent staging PET/CT and EUS. Data regarding tumor detection, lymph node identification, presence of metastatic disease, and affect on patient management were collected and compared between PET/CT and EUS. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients (65 male, 16 female) were identified with mean age of 63.5 years who underwent EUS and PET/CT to stage known ECA. PET/CT identified the primary tumor in 74/81 (91.4\%) of cases, compared to 81/81 (100\%) with EUS. Locoregional adenopathy was seen by PET/CT in 29/81 (35.8\%) of cases, compared to 49/81 (60.5\%) by EUS (p = 0.0001). PET/CT identified celiac axis adenopathy in 8/81 (9.9\%) of cases, compared to 11/81 (13.6\%) with EUS (p = 0.5050). PET/CT identified 17/81 (21.0\%) of patients with distant metastases who subsequently did not undergo attempt at curative surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: In ECA, EUS is superior to PET/CT for T staging and in identifying locoregional nodes, while PET/CT provides M staging. EUS and integrated PET/CT appear to independently affect treatment decisions, indicating complimentary and necessary roles in the staging of ECA.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study investigated the risk factors for severe weight loss (SWL) within one year after minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy. METHODS: Esophageal cancer patients who underwent McKeown esophagectomy between January and July 2017 were prospectively enrolled. Preoperative body weight (PBW) was chosen as the initial body weight. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled and successfully followed up for one year. Median weight loss was 7.4\% (quartile: 5.3-8.1\%) and 12.6\% (quartile: 8.8-17.7\%) four weeks and one year after surgery, respectively. Accelerated weight loss occurred during the first two weeks after discharge, with median weight loss of 5.6\% (quartile: 4.2-7.1\%). Multivariable analysis showed that age {$\geq$} 70 years (odds ratio [OR] 7.65; P = 0.030), preoperative sarcopenia (OR 7.18; P = 0.030), the first surgery in the daily schedule (OR 6.87; P = 0.032) and vocal cord paralysis (OR 12.30; P = 0.046) were independent risk factors for short-term (4 weeks) SWL ({$>$} 7.5\% PBW), while an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3-4 (OR 6.58; P = 0.047), a high fat-free mass (OR 21.91; P = 0.003), and vocal cord paralysis (OR 25.83; P = 0.017) were independent risk factors for long-term (1 year) SWL ({$>$} 13.0\% PBW) after esophagectomy. Postoperative symptoms of insomnia, appetite loss, dysphagia, eating difficulties, and taste issues were also related to SWL. CONCLUSIONS: In esophageal cancer patients who have undergone esophagectomy, the first two weeks after hospital discharge is a key period for nutrition intervention. Patients with associated factors for SWL require postoperative nutrition support.},

We conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the relationship between myosteatosis and the overall survival of digestive cancer patients. The systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase from inception through March 27, 2021. Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. Out of 3451 studies screened, 47 studies including 21,194 patients passed the screening criteria. The average prevalence of myosteatosis was 46.4\%. Patients with myosteatosis had 44\% increased mortality risk compared with non-myosteatosis patients (HR: 1.44, 95\% CI: 1.33-1.55, P {$<$} .05). The predictive value of myosteatosis held regardless of country zone, study design, statistical model, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) scores, treatment, sample size, and tumor stage. Nevertheless, the predictive value of myosteatosis was only evident for patients with esophagogastric cancers, cholangiocarcinoma/pancreatic cancers, or colorectal cancers. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis were robust based on sensitivity, subgroup, meta-regression, and trial sequential analyses and suggested that myosteatosis predicted worse overall survival (OS) in digestive malignancies patients.},

METHODS: Patients with SCC who underwent curative treatment from 2008 to 2014 were identified from the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Propensity score matching was undertaken to balance pretreatment clinical variables. Overall survival was compared between patients undergoing CRT-S or dCRT. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 5832 patients with clinical stage II and III oesophageal SCC receiving CRT-S (1754) or dCRT (4078) were included. After propensity score matching, each group included 1661 patients. The 3-year overall survival rate for patients treated with CRT-S was 41{$\cdot$}1 per cent compared with 17{$\cdot$}9 per cent for those who had dCRT (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001). In multivariable analysis, treatment modality was an independent prognostic factor in the overall cohort before propensity score matching: hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}45 (95 per cent c.i. 0{$\cdot$}40 to 0{$\cdot$}51) for CRT-S versus dCRT (P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}001). In separate analyses of patients with clinical stage II and those with stage III disease, CRT-S was associated with significantly better overall survival than dCRT.

  abstract = {Objectives There is increasing evidence that muscle volume and mass are poor predictors of muscle strength and physical performance. Other assessments of muscle quality such as skeletal muscle density measured by computed tomography (CT) may be more important. The aim of this study was to explore associations of muscle size and density with handgrip strength (HGS) and the Timed Up and Go test (TUG). We also hypothesized that the strength of these associations would depend on the specific muscle of muscle group, namely trunk, hip, and mid-thigh muscles. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting and Participants University hospital; 316 volunteers aged 59 to 85~years. Methods HGS, TUG, and quantitative CT imaging of the lumber, hip, and mid-thigh were performed in volunteers. From the CT images, cross-sectional area and attenuation were determined for the gluteus muscle, trunk muscle at vertebrae L2 level, and mid-thigh muscle. Results In men and women, associations of muscle area with TUG were insignificant after adjustment for age, height, and weight. Associations with HGS were only significant in men for the gluteus maximus and the mid-thigh but slopes were rather low ({$\beta~<~$}0.20). Associations between muscle density and TUG/HGS were more pronounced, in particular for HGS. After adjustment, associations with TUG were significant in women for the gluteus maximus and trunk muscle even ({$\beta~-$}0.06, P .001 and {$\beta~-$}0.07, P .031, respectively). Conclusions and Implications Muscle density is more strongly associated with muscle strength than muscle size andin women muscle density was also more strongly associated than muscle size with physical performance. Therefore, muscle density may represent a more clinically meaningful surrogate of muscle performance than muscle size. Muscle density measurements of trunk and gluteus muscles can be easily obtained from routine CT scan and, therefore, may become an important measurement to diagnose and screen for sarcopenia.},

  abstract = {Importance: Although optimal access is accepted as the key to quality care, an accepted methodology to ascertain potential disparities in surgical access has not been defined. Objective: To develop a systematic approach to detect surgical access disparities. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used publicly available data from the Health Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database from 2016. Using the surgical rate observed in the 5 highest-ranked counties (HRCs), the expected surgical rate in the 5 lowest-ranked counties (LRCs) in North Carolina were calculated. Patients 18 years and older who underwent an inpatient general surgery procedure and patients who underwent emergency inpatient cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy, or bariatric surgery in 2016 were included. Data were collected from January to December 2016, and data were analyzed from March to July 2020. Exposures: Health outcome county rank as defined by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the proportional surgical ratio (PSR), which was the disparity in surgical access defined as the observed number of surgical procedures in the 5 LRCs relative to the expected number of procedures using the 5 HRCs as the standardized reference population. Results: In 2016, approximately 1.9 million adults lived in the 5 HRCs, while approximately 246\,854 lived in the 5 LRCs. A total of 28\,924 inpatient general surgical procedures were performed, with 4521 being performed in those living in the 5 LRCs and 24\,403 in those living in the 5 HRCs. The rate of general surgery in the 5 HRCs was 13.09 procedures per 1000 population. Using the 5 HRCs as the reference, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 1.40 (95\% CI, 1.35-1.44). For emergent/urgent cholecystectomy, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 2.26 (95\% CI, 2.02-2.51), and the PSR for emergent/urgent herniorrhaphy was 1.83 (95\% CI, 1.33-2.45). Age-adjusted rate of obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] greater than 30), on average, was 36.6\% (SD, 3.4) in the 5 LRCs vs 25.4\% (SD, 4.6) in the 5 HRCs (P\,=\,.002). The rate of bariatric surgery in the 5 HRCs was 33.07 per 10\,000 population with obesity. For the 5 LRCs, the PSR was 0.60 (95\% CI, 0.51-0.69). Conclusions and Relevance: The PSR is a systematic approach to define potential disparities in surgical access and should be useful for identifying, investigating, and monitoring interventions intended to mitigate disparities in surgical access that effects the health of vulnerable populations.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of clinical staging, to assess survival with surgical resection alone, and to determine factors associated with understaging in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma thought to have limited local-regional disease. BACKGROUND: Primary surgical resection is the preferred treatment in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma clinically staged to have limited nodal disease. This approach requires reliable clinical staging. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients who had primary esophagectomy for clinical stage T1-3 N0-1 adenocarcinoma (seventh edition AJCC) from January 2002 to May 2013. Clinical and pathologic stages were compared and overall survival was analyzed. RESULTS: There were 88 patients who met inclusion criteria. Final pathology confirmed appropriate clinical staging ({$\leq$}T3N1) in 76\% of patients (67/88). There were 21 patients who were understaged ({$>$}T3N1), and in all cases, understaging was based on the presence of advanced nodal (N2 or N3) disease. Factors independently associated with understaging were the presence of dysphagia, tumor length {$>$}3{$\mkern1mu$}cm, and poor differentiation. At a median follow-up of 35 months, 63\% of all patients (55/88) remain alive. The 5-year survival in correctly staged patients was 67\%, compared with 33\% for those who were understaged (P {$<$} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Modern clinical staging will accurately identify the majority of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and limited local-regional disease ({$\leq$}pT3N1). Survival with surgery alone in correctly staged patients was excellent and unlikely to be improved with neoadjuvant therapy. A combination of dysphagia, poor differentiation, and tumor length {$>$}3{$\mkern1mu$}cm was associated with understaging in 92\% of patients. Patients with these factors are likely to have more advanced disease than clinically suspected and may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy before resection.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia and low skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) have been associated with adverse outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC); however, factors contributing to these 2 muscle abnormalities are unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of medical and demographic characteristics with muscle abnormalities among patients with nonmetastatic CRC. METHODS: Patients with stage I-III invasive CRC (2006-11) who had diagnostic computed tomography (CT) available from Kaiser Permanente Northern California electronic medical records were included. CT-assessed sarcopenia and low SMD were defined according to optimal stratification. Logistic regressions including age, stage, site, total adipose tissue (TAT), race/ethnicity, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, smoking history, alcohol use, and Charlson Comorbidity Score were performed to identify characteristics associated with muscle abnormalities. RESULTS: The study included 3262 patients (49.9\% females) with a mean {$\pm$} SD age of 62.6 {$\pm$} 11.4 y. Sarcopenia and low SMD were highly prevalent (42.4\% and 29.6\%, respectively). Age and sex interactions were noted for muscle mass, but not SMD. Age was associated with higher odds of muscle abnormalities in a dose-response manner. Compared with those aged {$\leq$}50 y, patients aged 70-80 y had considerably higher odds (OR: 6.19; 95\% CI: 4.72, 8.11) of sarcopenia, and low SMD (OR: 17.81; 95\% CI: 11.73, 27.03). High TAT was related to a higher odds of low SMD (OR: 9.62; 95\% CI: 7.37, 12.56), but lower odds of sarcopenia (OR: 0.59; 95\% CI: 0.48, 0.71). Compared with Caucasians, African Americans had lower odds of sarcopenia and low SMD. Patients with a higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio had higher odds of having both muscle abnormalities. Patients who were smokers or had any comorbidity had higher odds of low SMD, but not sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle abnormalities were common in patients with nonmetastatic CRC, with great variability in muscle mass and SMD across age, TAT, and race/ethnicity. Factors associated with muscle abnormalities may be used to facilitate risk stratification and the guidance of targeted strategies to counteract these abnormalities.},

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among 1630 patients who received a diagnosis of stage I to III colon cancer from January 2006 to December 2011 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, an integrated health care system. Preliminary data analysis started in 2017. Because major complication data were collected between 2018 and 2019, the final analysis using the current cohort was conducted between 2019 and 2020. EXPOSURES Low skeletal muscle index (SMI) and/or low skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD) levels were assessed using preoperative computerized tomography images. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Length of stay, any complication (Ն1 predefined complications) or major complications (Clavien-Dindo classification score Ն3), 30-day mortality and readmission up to 30 days postdischarge, and overall mortality. RESULTS The mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 64.0 (11.3) years and 906 (55.6\%) were women. Patients with low SMI or low SMD were more likely to remain hospitalized 7 days or longer after surgery (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.68; OR, 1.39; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.84, respectively) and had higher risks of overall mortality (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.74; hazard ratio, 1.44; 95\% CI, 1.12-1.85, respectively). Additionally, patients with low SMI were more likely to have 1 or more postsurgical complications (OR, 1.31; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.65) and had higher risk of 30-day mortality (OR, 4.85; 95\% CI, 1.23-19.15). Low SMD was associated with higher odds of having major complications (OR, 2.41; 95\% CI, 1.44-4.04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Low SMI and low SMD were associated with longer LOS, higher risk of postsurgical complications, and short-term and long-term mortality. Research should evaluate whether targeting potentially modifiable factors preoperatively, such as preserving muscle mass, could reverse the observed negative associations with postoperative outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of supra-clavicular lymph node (SCLN) metastases in esophageal cancer (EC) is still not clear. METHOD: From January 2009 to December 2015, a survival analysis was performed to retrospectively identify the prognostic value of SCLN metastasis on survival on 751 patients with EC treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy (dCRT). RESULTS: The median follow-up duration for living patients was 56.6 months. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 16.6 months. Patients with SCLN metastasis had a much poorer prognosis for OS ({$\chi$}2 = 17.342, P\,{$<$}\,0.001), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) ({$\chi$}2 = 24.793, P\,{$<$} 0.001) and progression-free survival (PFS) ({$\chi$}2 = 25.802, P\,{$<$} 0.001) than those without SCLN metastasis. The same results were found after propensity score matching. Nonetheless, the prognosis of patients with cervical or upper thoracic EC metastasis in SCLN was better than those of patients with middle or lower thoracic EC metastasis in SCLN for OS ({$\chi$}2 = 4.516, P\,= 0.038), DMFS ({$\chi$}2 = 8.326, P\,=\,0.004) and PFS ({$\chi$}2 = 6.255, P\,= 0.012). Univariate analysis showed that gender, middle or lower thoracic EC with SCLN metastasis, tumor length, tumor diameter, concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCR) and number of lymph nodes were prognostic factors for PFS. Gender, age, middle or lower thoracic EC with SCLN metastasis, tumor diameter, tumor length, and number of lymph nodes were prognostic factors for DMFS. According to the multivariate analysis, only middle or lower thoracic EC with SCLN metastasis and number of lymph nodes were independent prognostic factors for DMFS and PFS. CONCLUSION: For patients with cervical or upper thoracic EC, metastasis in SCLN should be considered to be regional lymph nodes and treated with curative intent if the total number of lymph nodes is limited. However, for patients with middle or lower thoracic EC, metastasis should be considered to be a higher level N stage or M1 stage, and it is thus necessary to provide consolidation chemotherapy after dCRT.},

  abstract = {Recently, PET response criteria in solid tumors (PERCIST) have been proposed as a new standardized method to assess chemotherapeutic response metabolically and quantitatively. The aim of this study was to evaluate therapeutic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer, comparing PERCIST with the currently widely used response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST). METHODS: Fifty-one patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, and cisplatin), followed by surgery were studied. Chemotherapeutic lesion responses were evaluated using (18)F-FDG PET and CT according to the RECIST and PERCIST methods. The PET/CT scans were obtained before chemotherapy and about 2 wk after completion of chemotherapy. Associations were statistically analyzed between survival (overall and disease-free survival) and clinicopathologic results (histology [well-, moderately, and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma], lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, clinical stage, pathologic stage, resection level, reduction rate of tumor diameter, reduction rate of tumor uptake, chemotherapeutic responses in RECIST and PERCIST, and pathologic response). RESULTS: There was a significant difference in response classification between RECIST and PERCIST (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P {$<$} 0.0001). Univariate analysis showed that lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, resection level, pathologic stage, and PERCIST were significant factors associated with disease-free or overall survival in this study. Although multivariate analysis demonstrated that venous invasion (disease-free survival: hazard ratio [HR] = 4.519, P = 0.002; overall survival: HR = 5.591, P = 0.003) and resection level (disease-free survival: HR = 11.078, P = 0.001) were the significant predictors, PERCIST was also significant in noninvasive therapy response assessment before surgery (disease-free survival: HR = 4.060, P = 0.025; overall survival: HR = 8.953, P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: RECIST based on the anatomic size reduction rate did not demonstrate the correlation between therapeutic responses and prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, PERCIST was found to be the strongest independent predictor of outcomes. Given the significance of noninvasive radiologic imaging in formulating clinical treatment strategies, PERCIST might be considered more suitable for evaluation of chemotherapeutic response to esophageal cancer than RECIST.},

  abstract = {Purpose The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) plus surgery for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains controversial. In this trial, we compared the survival and safety of NCRT plus surgery with surgery alone in patients with locally advanced ESCC. Patients and Methods From June 2007 to December 2014, 451 patients with potentially resectable thoracic ESCC, clinically staged as T1-4N1M0/T4N0M0, were randomly allocated to NCRT plus surgery (group CRT; n = 224) and surgery alone (group S; n = 227). In group CRT, patients received vinorelbine 25 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV day 1, or 25 mg/m2 IV on days 1 to 4 every 3 weeks for two cycles, with a total concurrent radiation dose of 40.0 Gy administered in 20 fractions of 2.0 Gy on 5 days per week. In both groups, patients underwent McKeown or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. The primary end point was overall survival. Results The pathologic complete response rate was 43.2\% in group CRT. Compared with group S, group CRT had a higher R0 resection rate (98.4\% v 91.2\%; P = .002), a better median overall survival (100.1 months v 66.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.53 to 0.96; P = .025), and a prolonged disease-free survival (100.1 months v 41.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.43 to 0.78; P {$<$} .001). Leukopenia (48.9\%) and neutropenia (45.7\%) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events during chemoradiotherapy. Incidences of postoperative complications were similar between groups, with the exception of arrhythmia (group CRT: 13\% v group S: 4.0\%; P = .001). Peritreatment mortality was 2.2\% in group CRT versus 0.4\% in group S ( P = .212). Conclusion This trial shows that NCRT plus surgery improves survival over surgery alone among patients with locally advanced ESCC, with acceptable and manageable adverse events.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between CT-derived muscle metrics and standardized metrics of sarcopenia in patients undergoing routine CT imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collected in 443 consecutive patients included body CT, grip strength, usual gait speed, and responses to SARC-F and FRAIL scale questionnaires. Functional and clinical metrics of sarcopenia were acquired at the time of CT. Metrics were analyzed using the diagnostic framework of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2). The skeletal muscle index (SMI) and skeletal muscle density (SMD) were measured at the T12 and L3 levels. Statistical methods include linear prediction models and ROC analysis. RESULTS: T12-SMD and L3-SMD in women and T12-SMD and L3-SMI in men show weak but significant (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) predictive value for gait speed, after adjusting for subject age and body mass index. The prevalence of abnormal CT SMI at T12 and L3 was 29\% and 71\%, respectively, corresponding to prevalences of confirmed sarcopenia by EWGSOP2 of 10\% and 15\%, respectively. The agreement of abnormal SARC-F and FRAIL scale screening and EWGSOP2 confirmed sarcopenia was slight to fair (kappa: 0.20-0.28). CT cutpoints, based on EWGSOP2 criteria for abnormal grip strength or gait speed, are generally lower than cutpoints based on normative population data. CONCLUSION: Collection of clinical and functional sarcopenia information at the point of imaging care can be accomplished quickly and safely. CT-derived muscle metrics show convergent validity with gait speed. Only a minority of subjects with low CT metrics have confirmed sarcopenia by EWGSOP2 definition.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: After curative resection, the prognosis of gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is poor. This phase III trial was designed to evaluate the benefit in overall survival (OS) of perioperative fluorouracil plus cisplatin in resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 224 patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), or stomach were randomly assigned to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (CS group; n = 113) or surgery alone (S group; n = 111). Chemotherapy consisted of two or three preoperative cycles of intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m(2)) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (800 mg/m(2)/d) for 5 consecutive days (days 1 to 5) every 28 days and three or four postoperative cycles of the same regimen. The primary end point was OS. RESULTS: Compared with the S group, the CS group had a better OS (5-year rate 38\% v 24\%; hazard ratio [HR] for death: 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.50 to 0.95; P = .02); and a better disease-free survival (5-year rate: 34\% v 19\%; HR, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.48 to 0.89; P = .003). In the multivariable analysis, the favorable prognostic factors for survival were perioperative chemotherapy (P = .01) and stomach tumor localization (P {$<$} .01). Perioperative chemotherapy significantly improved the curative resection rate (84\% v 73\%; P = .04). Grade 3 to 4 toxicity occurred in 38\% of CS patients (mainly neutropenia) but postoperative morbidity was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: In patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower esophagus, GEJ, or stomach, perioperative chemotherapy using fluorouracil plus cisplatin significantly increased the curative resection rate, disease-free survival, and OS.},

  abstract = {Background: Our previous work showed that para-aortic lymph node (PALN) metastasis was the major failure pattern in lower thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LTESCC) patients who presented abdominal LN failure after curative surgery. We thereby aim to generate a computerized tomography (CT)-based documentation of PALNs and to propose a clinical target volume (CTV) for this region. Methods: Sixty-five patients were enrolled. The epicentre of each PALN was drawn onto an axial CT image of a standard patient with reference to the surrounding anatomical landmarks. A CTV for PALN was generated based on the final result of node distribution, and was evaluated for dosimetric performance in three simulated patients. Results: All the studied 248 LNs were below the level of 1.0 cm above the celiac artery (CA), and 94.76\% were above the bottom of vertebra L3. Horizontally, 93.33\% of the LNs in the celiac level were located within an expansion of 1.5 cm on the CA, and 94.12\% of the LNs in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) level were within 1.5 cm on the left side of the SMA. Below the SMA, all the LNs were behind the left renal vein, left to the right border of the inferior vena cava, and 98.51\% of the LNs were medial to the lateral surface of the left psoas major. The proposed CTV could cover 92.74\% of the LNs and was dosimetrically feasible. Conclusions: The proposed CTV is the first one to focus on the high-risk area of abdominal failure in LTESCC patients after surgery and can serve as a reference in the adjuvant radiotherapy for LTESCC patients.},

  pages = {10},
  abstract = {Background Unintentional weight loss is a major problem for patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers because it affects treatment, survival outcomes, and quality of life. To date, little is known about the trajectory of weight loss and the relationship between baseline body mass index (BMI), location of the cancer, and outcomes. The aims of this study were to investigate patterns of weight loss over time in patients with GI cancer according to BMI groups (low, normal, and high) and location of cancer. Methods We examined de-identified electronic medical record data of 801 adults ({$>$}21 years) with GI cancer using ICD-9 codes (150\textendash 159). Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models were used to examine unintentional weight loss over time by BMI group (low, normal, and high) and to determine the effect of primary cancer site and patient characteristics on weight loss. Results The mean age of patients was 66.5 {$\pm$} 11.9 years (21\textendash 95 years), with 58\% male and 86\% White. Mean weight loss over 3 years was 21.39 kg. At the first observation point, 7.8\% were in the low BMI group, 30.1\% were in the normal, and 62\% were in the high group. At the end of observation, a majority of deaths (35.5\%) occurred in the low BMI group (BMI {$<$} 20 kg/m2). Significant weight loss was observed in patients with gastric (t = \`A5.11, P {$<$} 0.001), oesophageal (t = \`A4.18, P {$<$} 0.001), and pancreatic (35.8\%, t = \`A3.58, P {$<$} 0.001) cancers. Predictors of weight change were gender (F = 64.93, P {$<$} 0.001), cancer stage (F = 7.28, P {$<$} 0.001), and site by days (F = 8.24, P {$<$} 0.001). Weight loss rates were similar among the three BMI groups, but patterns were different based on primary cancer type as a function of days within each group. Conclusions Weight loss in patients with GI cancers has implications for survival. Patients with upper GI cancers experienced more weight loss and decreased survival rates compared with patients with lower GI cancers. Patients with a combination of upper GI cancer (oesophagogastric or pancreatic) and low baseline BMI had the fewest survival days and worst patient outcomes. Early intervention for weight management plays a critical role for improving the health outcomes and fatality rates of these patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Sarcopenia has been widely recognized as an important predictor of poor outcomes in patients with cancer after surgery, but the controversy remains, and its impact on surgical and oncologic outcomes in patients after abdominal surgery for digestive tract cancer is poorly described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of sarcopenia on surgical and oncologic outcomes in patients after abdominal surgery for digestive tract cancer. METHODS: Six thousand four hundred and forty-seven consecutive patients who underwent abdominal surgery for digestive tract cancer in our institution were prospectively included. Sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle index below the lowest sex-specific quartile using computed tomography scan at L3 before surgery. The surgical and oncologic outcomes were recorded, and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Sarcopenia was present in 1638 of 6447 patients (25.4\%) with digestive tract cancer before surgery based on the diagnostic cut-off values (43.13~cm2/m2 for men and 37.81~cm2/m2 for women). The incidence of postoperative total and pulmonary complications, and 30-day readmission were significantly higher in sarcopenic group than in nonsarcopenic group (37.4\% vs 12.9\%, P~{$<~$}0.001; 3.1\% vs 2.1\%, P~=~0.026; 1.1\% vs 0.4\%, P~=~0.003, respectively). The postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in sarcopenic patients (9.42~{$\pm~$}3.40 vs 8.51~{$\pm~$}3.17 days, P~{$<~$}0.001). There were significantly more patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy in sarcopenic group than in nonsarcopenic group (73.1\% vs 69.2\%, P~=~0.003; 10.6\% vs 8.8\%, P~=~0.038, respectively), and patients with sarcopenia had significantly more chemotherapy modifications including delay, dose reduction, or termination (48.5\% vs 44.2\%, P~=~0.018). In addition, during the follow-up period, sarcopenic patients had significantly lower rate of overall survival and disease-free survival than nonsarcopenic patients (53.9\% vs 69.3\%, P~=~0.002; 36.8\% vs 59.7\%, P~=~0.000, respectively). In multivariate analysis, sarcopenia was found to be a risk factor for postoperative complications [odds ratio (OR)~=~5.418, 95\% confidence interval (CI)~=~2.986-9.828, P~{$<~$}0.001], and was an unfavorable prognostic factor for poor overall survival [hazard ratio (HR)~=~0.649, 95\% CI~=~0.426-0.991, P~=~0.045] and disease-free survival (HR~=~0.514, 95\% CI~=~0.348-0.757, P~=~0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenia could be used as a strong and independent prognostic factor for poor surgical and oncologic outcomes in patients after abdominal surgery for digestive tract cancer. Identification of preoperative sarcopenia in digestive surgery for cancer and targeted approaches may improve its negative outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) has been associated with the risk of oesophageal cancer. But the influence of BMI on postoperative complication and prognosis has always been controversial. METHODS: In total, 2031 consecutive patients who underwent oesophagectomy between 1998 and 2008 were classified according to Asian-specific BMI (kg\,m(-2)) cutoff values. The impact of BMI on overall survival (OS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard models. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the association of BMI with OS and postoperative complication. RESULTS: Patients with higher BMI had more postoperative complication (P=0.002), such as anastomotic leakage (P=0.016) and cardiovascular diseases (P{$<$}0.001), but less incidence of chylous leakage (P=0.010). Logistic regression analysis showed that BMI (P=0.005) was a confounding factor associated with postoperative complication. Multivariate analysis showed that overweight and obese patients had a more favourable survival than normal weight patients (HR (hazard ratio) = 0.80, 95\% CI (confidence interval): 0.70-0.92, P=0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the association with higher BMI and increased OS was observed in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (P{$<$}0.001), oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) (P=0.034), never-smoking (P=0.035), ever-smoking (P=0.035), never alcohol consumption (P=0.005), weight loss (P=0.003) and advanced pathological stage (P{$<$}0.001). The meta-analysis further corroborated that higher BMI was associated with increased complication of anastomotic leakage (RR (risk ratio)=1.04, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.06, P=0.001), wound infection (RR=1.03, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.05, P=0.031) and cardiovascular diseases (RR=1.02, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.05, P=0.039), but decreased incidence of chylous leakage (RR=0.98, 95\% CI: 0.96-0.99, P{$<$}0.001). In addition, high BMI could significantly improved OS (HR=0.78, 95\% CI: 0.71-0.85, P{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative BMI was an independent prognostic factor for survival, and strongly associated with postoperative complications in oesophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for treating cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction remains controversial. In the present study, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of these two management strategies. METHODS: The MEDLINE (PubMed), SinoMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for eligible studies. We searched for the most relevant studies published until the end of September 2017. Data were extracted independently and were analyzed using RevMan statistical software version 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, http://tech.cochrane.org/revman/download). Weighted mean differences, risk ratios (RRs), and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. In this comprehensive meta-analysis, we examined the efficiency of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction as reported in qualified clinical trials. RESULTS: Six qualified articles that included a total of 866 patients were identified. The meta-analysis showed that for 3-year and 5-year survival rates in primary outcomes, the results favored neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy strategies compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (RR = 0.78, 95\% CI = 0.62-0.98, P = 0.03; RR = 0.69, 95\% CI = 0.50-0.96, P = 0.03, respectively). In terms of secondary outcomes, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy significantly increased the rate of R0 resection and pathological complete response as well (RR = 0.87, 95\% CI = 0.81-0.92, P {$<$} 0.0001; RR = 0.16, 95\% CI = 0.09-0.28, P {$<$} 0.00001, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in postoperative mortality between the two groups (RR = 1.85, 95\% CI = 0.93-3.65, P = 0.08). For the results of postoperative complications, revealed that there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of postoperative complications such as pulmonary, anastomotic leak and cardiovascular complications. The subgroup analysis of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma showed that both esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients achieved a high rate of R0 resection (RR = 0.85, 95\% CI = 0.77-0.93, P = 0.0006; RR = 0.88, 95\% CI = 0.81-0.96, P = 0.005, respectively) and pathological complete response benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (RR = 0.23, 95\% CI = 0.09-0.57, P = 0.001; RR = 0.18, 95\% CI = 0.03-0.96, P = 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should be recommended with a significant long-term survival benefit in patients with cancer of the esophagus or the gastroesophageal junction. In view of the clinical heterogeneity, whether these conclusions are broadly applicable should be further determined.},

  abstract = {Some controversy surrounds the postoperative feeding regimen utilized in patients who undergo esophagectomy. Variation in practices during the perioperative period exists including the type of nutrition started, the delivery route, and its timing. Adequate nutrition is essential for this patient population as these patients often present with weight loss and have altered eating patterns after surgery, which can affect their ability to regain or maintain weight. Methods of feeding after an esophagectomy include total parenteral nutrition, nasoduodenal/nasojejunal tube feeding, jejunostomy tube feeding, and oral feeding. Recent evidence suggests that early oral feeding is associated with shorter LOS, faster return of bowel function, and improved quality of life. Enhanced recovery pathways after surgery pathways after esophagectomy with a component of early oral feeding also seem to be safe, feasible, and cost-effective, albeit with limited data. However, data on anastomotic leaks is mixed, and some studies suggest that the incidence of leaks may be higher with early oral feeding. This risk of anastomotic leak with early feeding may be heavily modulated by surgical approach. No definitive data is currently available to definitively answer this question, and further studies should look at how these early feeding regimens vary by surgical technique. This review aims to discuss the existing literature on the optimal route and timing of feeding after esophagectomy.},

METHODS: Patients with stage II-III oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with TMT or BMT from 2002 to 2017 were evaluated. The BMT group consisted of patients who were otherwise eligible for surgery but underwent chemoradiation alone followed by observation. This group included patients who later had salvage oesophagectomy. Survival was evaluated and compared between TMT and BMT groups. Elastic net regularization was performed to select co-variables for Cox multivariable survival analysis in patients with a clinical complete response. RESULTS: Of 143 patients, 60 (41.9 per cent) underwent TMT and 83 (58.0 per cent) BMT. Patients who underwent TMT had longer median overall survival than those who had BMT (77 versus 33\,months; P\,=\,0.019). For patients with a clinical complete response, TMT achieved longer median overall survival than BMT (123 versus 55\,months; P\,=\,0.04). BMT had a high locoregional recurrence rate (48 versus 6 per cent; P\,{$<$}\,0.001); 26 of 29 patients with locoregional recurrence in the BMT groupunderwent salvage resection. Cox multivariable analysis demonstrated that upper-mid oesophageal tumour location (hazard ratio (HR) 2.04; P\,=\,0.024) and tumour length (HR 1.18; P\,=\,0.046) were associated with worse survival. Although TMT was not associated with survival, it was a predictor of reduced recurrence (HR 0.28; P\,=\,0.028). The maximum standardized uptake value after chemoradiation also predicted recurrence (HR 1.33; P\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients who achieve a clinical complete response, TMT reduces locoregional recurrence but may not prolong survival. The differences in survival outcomes may be due to patient selection; therefore, a selective-surgery strategy in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a reasonable approach.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Compared with open oesophagectomy (OE), minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) proves to have benefits in reducing the risk of pulmonary complications for patients with resectable oesophageal cancer. However, it is unknown whether MIO has superiority in reducing the occurrence of in-hospital mortality (IHM). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis was to explore the effect of MIO vs. OE on the occurrence of in-hospital mortality (IHM). DATA SOURCES: Sources such as Medline (through December 31, 2014), Embase (through December 31, 2014), Wiley Online Library (through December 31, 2014), and the Cochrane Library (through December 31, 2014) were searched. STUDY SELECTION: Data of randomized and non-randomized clinical trials related to MIO versus OE were included. INTERVENTIONS: Eligible studies were those that reported patients who underwent MIO procedure. The control group included patients undergoing conventional OE. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Fixed or random -effects models were used to calculate summary odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) for quantification of associations. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies involving 14,311 cases of resectable oesophageal cancer were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to patients undergoing OE, patients undergoing MIO had statistically reduced occurrence of IHM (OR=0.69, 95\%CI =0.55 -0.86). Patients undergoing MIO also had significantly reduced incidence of pulmonary complications (PCs) (RR=0.73, 95\%CI = 0.63-0.86), pulmonary embolism (PE) (OR=0.71, 95\%CI= 0.51-0.99) and arrhythmia (OR=0.79, 95\%CI = 0.68-0.92). Non-significant reductions were observed among the included studies in the occurrence of anastomotic leak (AL) (OR=0.93, 95\%CI =0.78-1.11), or Gastric Tip Necrosis (GTN) (OR=0.89, 95\%CI =0.54-1.49). LIMITATION: Most of the included studies were non-randomized case-control studies, with a diversity of study designs, demographics of participants and surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive oesophagectomy (MIO) has superiority over open oesophagectomy (OE) in terms of the occurrence of in-hospital mortality (IHM) and should be the first-choice surgical procedure in esophageal surgery.},
