# CT measurement of body composition

Axial CT scanning has facilitated the estimation of body composition analysis, which has focused upon the skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle density, and visceral adipose tissue.

The most common facile measure of muscle mass is the cross-sectional area and density of muscle at the L3 level, as measured on abdominal CT scan {Prado, 2008 #1848;Fearon, 2011 #1851;Mourtzakis, 2008 #1853}. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (MSA) is most commonly measured at the L3 level using image analysis software to identify all tissue between -29 and 150 Hounsfield Units {Martin, 2013 #1965}.

A less common, but faster method is the extrapolation of muscle mass from the psoas diameter {Peng, 2011 #1946;Jones, 2015 #1959}, but some comparative studies have questioned the predictive ability of psoas diameter {Rutten, 2017 #1979;Martin, 2013 #1965;Ebadi,  #1982} as a substitute for muscle cross-sectional area.

Cross-sectional muscle area is frequently normalized to body height to calculate the Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI).

Reduction in muscle mass can also be accompanied by an increased proportion of intra-muscular fat {Delmonico,  #1983}. The density of muscle mass on cross-sectional imaging has been used to estimate the Skeletal Muscle Density (SMD), which represents fatty infiltration of the muscle, which is based upon the differential density of fat and muscle on CT imaging.

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) can be measured in similar fashion to skeletal muscle, using analysis of axial CT images.

# Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT)

Among a group of 42 patiens underoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer, an elevated ratio of visceral adipose tissue to skeletal muscle as associated with postoperative complications.[@sandini1231]

Investigators at McMaster University examined 50 patients with pancreatic cancer and serially measured body skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue.  They found that survival was shorter in patients with more accelerated skeletal muscle loss as well as in those the loss of visceral adipose tissue. Similar findings were reported by Tan et al {Birdsell,6973}.[@birdsell6973]
