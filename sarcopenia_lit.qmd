# CT measurement of body composition

Axial CT scanning has facilitated the estimation of body composition analysis, which has focused upon the skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle density, and visceral adipose tissue.

The most common facile measure of muscle mass is the cross-sectional area and density of muscle at the L3 level, as measured on abdominal CT scan {Prado, 2008 #1848;Fearon, 2011 #1851;Mourtzakis, 2008 #1853}. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (MSA) is most commonly measured at the L3 level using image analysis software to identify all tissue between -29 and 150 Hounsfield Units {Martin, 2013 #1965}.

A less common, but faster method is the extrapolation of muscle mass from the psoas diameter {Peng, 2011 #1946;Jones, 2015 #1959}, but some comparative studies have questioned the predictive ability of psoas diameter {Rutten, 2017 #1979;Martin, 2013 #1965;Ebadi,  #1982} as a substitute for muscle cross-sectional area.

Cross-sectional muscle area is frequently normalized to body height to calculate the Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI).

Reduction in muscle mass can also be accompanied by an increased proportion of intra-muscular fat {Delmonico,  #1983}. The density of muscle mass on cross-sectional imaging has been used to estimate the Skeletal Muscle Density (SMD), which represents fatty infiltration of the muscle, which is based upon the differential density of fat and muscle on CT imaging.

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) can be measured in similar fashion to skeletal muscle, using analysis of axial CT images.

Published literature quotes an interobserver coefficient of variation of 1.5% {Prado, 2008 #1848}

Manual segmentation with Mimics. In the input pipeline, the ground truth image was extracted from the Mimics-exportedDigital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) using a simple R \[69\] procedure, with the oro.nifti \[70\] library providing input and output functionality. The mask was cleaned using a custom Python script built with NiBabel \[71\] for I/O, SciPy \[72\] for spatial calculations, and NumPy \[73\] for general numeric operations. Additional preparation of ground truth data used the ImageMath and fslstats programs of the Advanced Normalization Tools \[74\] and FMRIB Software Library \[75\] respectively. Preparation of the 3-channel input images used scikit-image's \[76\] rescale_intensity and equalize_adapthist functions for clipping and equalization. Overlap measures were implemented as functions of the confusion matrix provided by scikit-learn's \[77\] confusion_matrix function and assembled into easily-analyzed tabular representations using Pandas \[78\]. Subsequent correlation analyses of the muscle CSA and MA were performed with R's cor.test function.

# Physiometric Evaluation

## Pulmonary function testing.

Investigators in Kobe, Japan examined functional testing in 104 patients undergoing esophagectomy [@makiura] , 2016, 2016}. Patients were designated as frail based upon hand-grip strength \<26kg and sarcopenia as measured radiographically. Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 29 patients, in whom the rate of pneumonia was 38%, compared with 17% in the remaining patients.
