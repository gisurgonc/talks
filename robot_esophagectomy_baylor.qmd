Camera just above umbilicus 5mm RUQ liver retractor 10mm assistant in right rectus

Abdominal Phase (Steps 1-8)

1.Division of gastroesophageal and phrenoesophageal ligaments and right crural dissection. An energy device is used to divide the gastrohepatic ligament and the esophagus is dissected from the right crus. Dissection is carried anteriorly where the phrenoesophageal ligament is divided. Disssection posterior to esophagus

2.Division of left gastric artery and vein. Common hepatic artery nodes taken with specimen. The left gastric artery and vein are dissected and surrounding lymph nodes are swept toward the stomach; they can be removed at this time or with the specimen later. The artery and vein are divided with Weck clips or a vascular cartridge stapler.

Dissection from lesser curvature 3.Preparation of right gastroepiploic pedicle. The right gastroepiploic artery and vein are identified, the lesser sac is entered, and a healthy pedicle of right gastroepiploic adipose is created. Dissection continues towards the pylorus and then cranially along the stomach's greater curvature.

4.Creation of pedicled omental flap and division of short gastric arteries and veins. A pedicled omental flap is designed based on right gastroepiploic and short gastric arterial inflow, and the highest short gastric vessels are divided. 5.Mediastinal dissection. A Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus, approximated to itself (ie with a stapler), and used for retraction to circumferentially dissect the mediastinal esophagus to the level of the inferior pulmonary veins. The Penrose is tucked into the mediastinum.

6.Creation of gastric conduit. The lesser curvature adipose is divided between the caudal 2 branches of the right gastric artery and a 4-cm wide conduit is created with serial applications of green staple cartridges. The conduit is never itself directly grasped.

Assistant retracts the gastric fundus toward the left upper quadrant. Tip up has gastric tip length 60mm to help gauge diameter of gastric tube (5cm).

Can leave GE junction and conduit still connected OR divide completely and re-suture.

Suture JP2 to the GE junction to pull it into the chest cavity.

End of first staple line is tagged with Vicryl suture as a marker to guide transposition of conduit into chest.

7.Treatment of the pylorus (chemical pyloroplasty). The pylorus can be treated in various ways. Here, botulism toxin is injected laparoscopically into several regions of its muscle. 8.Laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy tube. A 14F jejunostomy tube is placed 40 cm from the ligament of Treitz, shown here using T fasteners. Thoracic Phase (Steps 9-15)

![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/burt_thorax.png)

9.Division of inferior pulmonary ligament and station 9 nodal dissection. Port placement is detailed in Video 1. The inferior pulmonary ligament is divided and station 9 lymph nodes are removed. 10.Entry into mediastinum, dissection of distal esophagus, station 8 nodal dissection. The mediastinum is entered and the Penrose drain is retrieved and used for retraction to dissect the distal esophagus. Station 8 lymph does are removed and/or dissected in such a way that they are removed with the specimen. 11.Dissection of mid-esophagus and station 7/8/10 lymph nodes. The mid-esophagus is dissected from the airway with precise application of energy. Station 7, 8, and 10 lymph nodes are removed. 12.Division of azygous vein, dissection of upper esophagus, station 2/4 nodal dissection. The azygous vein is divided with a vascular stapler cartridge and the upper esophagus is dissected. A paratracheal nodal dissection is completed. 13.Completion of conduit and removal of specimen. The conduit is delivered into the thorax and it is separated from the specimen with green staple cartridges. The specimen is removed through the assistant port incision. 14.Anastomosis. The staple line of the upper thoracic esophagus is removed sharply, the geometry of the anastomosis is planned, and a small gastrotomy is made on the conduit. A green cartridge unites the esophagus and conduit and the common enterotomy is closed, here using two running layers. 15.Omental flap buttress. The omental flap is positioned between the conduit and airway and the anastomosis is loosely wrapped.

## Hand-sewn Anastomosis

Italy [@huscher1034] 40 patients over 4 years

All patients underwent a fast-track surgical protocol. The Da Vinci ® Si robotic system was positioned perpendicular to the patient’s right side and docked to the trocars. For the abdominal part of the procedure, the patient was positioned in a supine position. The four robotic trocars were placed in a horizontal line at or above the umbilicus (Fig. 1). In the abdomen, CO2 insufflation with 14 mmHg of pressure was used. Targeting to the stomach was performed. The surgical assistant was located on the left side of the table. A tip-up fenestrated grasper in trocar 1 was used to elevate the left lobe of the liver and for certain retraction movements during the abdominal part. The fenestrated bipolar forceps were used in the 12-mm trocar (no. 2) with a reduction cartridge, and later the 12-mm trocar was used for the robotic Endo Wrist ® stapler 45 mm to form the gastric conduit, beginning from the lesser curvature near the crow foot and continued towards the fundus, parallel to the greater curvature. After the abdominal dissection and creation of the conduit for reconstruction, Indocyanine Green (ICG) test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of the gastric conduit. For the thoracic part of the procedure (Fig. 2), the patient was positioned in a prone position (the operation table was tilted 19° towards the prone) and three robotic trocars and one laparoscopic trocar were inserted on the right chest. A single-lumen tube was used for intubation and the right lung was not deflated and disconnected from ventilation. In the chest, CO2 insufflation with 8 mmHg of pressure was enough to obtain an optimal working volume. The pulmonary ligament was divided. Hereafter, the parietal pleura was dissected at the anterior side of the esophagus from the diaphragm, up to the azygos vein. The azygos vein was ligated with Hem-o-lok and divided. At the posterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is dissected cranially to caudally along the azygos vein, including the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct was clipped with a 10-mm endoclip. To facilitate esophagus mobilization, a Penrose drain was placed around the esophagus to manipulate the esophagus for further mobilization. The thoracic esophagus was mobilized and transected at the level of the azygos vein. The esophagus was resected en bloc with the surrounding mediastinal lymph nodes. The resected specimen will contain right-side paratracheal (station 2R), tracheobronchial (station 4), aortopulmonary window (station 5), carinal (station 7), and periesophageal (station 8) lymph nodes. The reconstruction time started with the anchoring of the gastric conduit to the esophageal stump with two 3–0 silk stay sutures. The conduit was opened on the anterior wall by the adoption of a monopolar hook. An end-to-side roboticsewn anastomosis was created by the adoption of two 3–0 running barbed sutures (V-loc – Medtronic, USA – Fig. 3).11, 12 After completion of the anterior wall, a nasogastric tube was passed through the half-completed anastomosis. Once the anastomosis was completed, 3–0 silk interrupted sutures were placed circumferentially to reinforce it (Fig. 4; Video). Before and after anastomosis fashioning, an ICG test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of conduit. In addition, the conduit cul-de-sac was suspended at the posterior thoracic wall by two stitches. The specimen was extracted through a small thoracotomy and a right-sided chest tube was placed. No postoperative swallow tests were performed. In the absence of clinical signs of anastomotic dehiscence (for example, luminal contents through the drain or wound site/local inflammation; fever (\> 38 °C) or leukocytosis (\> 10,000/L); leak may also be detected on imaging studies), patients started with sips of water at the day 3 and the oral intake was gradually increased to solid food. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines were used in the postoperative protocol.

Stricture 10/40 = 25%

Italy 30 patients [@marano941]

Single‐lung ventilation is introduced, and the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, tilted 45° compared to the prone position. For both robotic systems, the cart is docked from the right side of the patient. In addition, three robotic ports are put in place as well as two thoracoscopic ports for the assistant. dV®SiTM port layout for this stage has previously been described \[24\]. It’s worthy of mention that an additional 5 mm port for the assistant is placed between the intercostal spaces (ICS) 6 and 10, along the posterior axillary line. Figure 2 shows the dV®XiTM trocar position (three-arms technique) in a slight U shape: robotic arm#1(R1) for the grasper or the bipolar forceps at the ICS 9, robotic arm#2 (R2) for the 30° down scope at the ICS 6, posterior to the posterior axillary line and robotic arm#3 (R3) for the monopolar cautery hook, the needle driver or the clip applier at the ICS 4, anterior to the scapular rim. Furthermore assistant port #1(A1, 12-mm) is located in the ILC 8, and assistant port #2 (A2, 5 mm) between R2 and R3 at the posterior axillary line. The targeting area is identified at the level of the Azygos arch. A 7–8 mmHg pneumothorax is then induced. Starting at the anterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is cut from the level of the azygos arch down to the diaphragm where the pulmonary ligament is divided. The azygos arch is then sectioned with robotic Weck Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) and a right paratracheal lymphadenectomy is performed. Next, the dissection of the parietal pleura is deepened towards the esophageal hiatus until the aorta becomes exposed. Subsequently, the right vagus nerve is sectioned just below the carina, preserving its bronchial branches. The dissection of the esophagus is extended below the tracheal bifurcation and a Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus to facilitate traction.

The dissection of the esophagus is then continued along the pericardium down to the diaphragm and the thoracic duct is clipped with robotic clips. The resection of the esophagus en-bloc with periesophageal, bronchial and subcarinal nodes (stations \# 107–111) and the thoracic duct is fully completed from the diaphragm up to the azygos arch. The proximal esophagus is divided using a robotic cautery hook above the level of the azygos vein. At this point, the instruments in R1 and R3 are reversed to be able to carefully pull the esophago-gastric bloc and the gastric conduit up through the hiatus until the marker suture becomes visible. The specimen and conduit thus are disconnected, and the specimen is placed in a plastic bag which will be removed through the enlarged incision of the assistant port. Thereafter, four supportive 4-0 polyglactin 910 (Ethicon Inc. USA) stitches are put in between the mucosae and the muscularis externa layer of the esophagus at the four cardinal points to evert the esophageal mucosae. Next, the proximal esophagus is dilatated using a Foley catheter inflated with 10 cc of sterile water for approximately 2–3 min. After having assessed both gastric conduit and esophageal perfusion with ICG fluorescence, a gastrotomy is performed at the most proximal portion of the conduit, maintaining at least 2 cm of distance from the stapler line. A single-layer robot-sewn esophagogastric anastomosis is performed above the level of the azygos arch with two separate running self-locking barbed sutures (Filbloc® 3/0, Assut Europe, Italy or alternatively V-LocTM 3/0, Medtronic, USA) that run in the same direction from 3 to 9 o’clock. Of note is the fact that, after having applied the first stitch on the posterior wall we customarily pass the needle back below the first stitch to evert the posterior esophageal and gastric layer and improve their visualization. Once the posterior aspect of the anastomosis is complete, a NGT is placed under direct vision inside the stomach distally to the anastomosis, thus accomplishing the closure of anterior surface. Finally, a few tension release stitches are put in between the mediastinal pleura and seromuscular layer of the gastric tube. The anastomosis is checked for intraoperative leaks with methylene blue and a 28-Fr chest drain is inserted via the R1 robotic trocar, posteriorly to anastomosis, with the apex in the upper chest (Video).

The primary outcomes were anastomotic leak and conduit necrosis, as defined by the ECCG framework.7 Anastomotic leak was defined as a full-thickness gastro-intestinal defect involving the esophagus, anastomosis, staple line, or conduit, irrespective of presentation or method of identification. These were further categorized as follows: Type I: Local defect requiring no change in therapy, or treated medically or with dietary modification. Type II: Localized defect, requiring interventional but not surgical therapy, for example interventional radiology drain, stent, or bedside opening and packing of incision. Type III: Localized defect requiring surgical therapy.

Conduit necrosis was defined as postoperative identification of necrosis or ischemia affecting the gastric conduit, and was further categorized as: Type I: Focal necrosis identified endoscopically, requiring additional monitoring or nonsurgical therapy. Type II: Focal necrosis identified endoscopically, and not associated with free anastomotic or conduit leak, which required surgical therapy not involving esophageal diversion. Type III: Extensive necrosis treated with conduit resection with diversion.
