## Trans-abdominal Rectal Surgery

Trans-abdominal procedures include

-   Low anterior resection: Removal of the rectum with an anastomosis between colon and distal rectum
-   Hartmann resection: Removal of the rectum with end colostomy. The rectal stump is stapled. The anal sphincters are left in situ
-   Abdominoperineal resection: Removal of rectum and anus from both an abdominal and perineal approach. The anal sphincters are removed.

## Rectal Adjuvant Therapy 

Surgery as sole treatment for rectal cancer is associated with an unacceptable rate of local recurrence. Accordingly, adjunctive stratagies were employed to reduce risk of local recurrence.

## GI Tumor Study Group 1985

227 rectal cancer patients with curative surgical resection:

\

- 58: Control with no further therapy
- 50: Postop radiation alone 4000 or 4800cGy
- 48: Postop chemotherapy 5FU+methyl-CCNU
- 46: Chemo + radiation

## GI Tumor Study Group 1985

Local Recurrence

- 55%: Control with no further therapy
- 50: Postop radiation alone 4000 or 4800cGy
- 48: Postop chemotherapy 5FU+methyl-CCNU
- 33%: Chemo + radiation

No difference in overall survival

## Total Mesorectal Excision

![](https://deidt7p41jzcy.cloudfront.net/AnnGastroenterol-35-226-g002.jpg)
## Total Mesorectal Excicsion (1986)

115 rectal cancer patients underwent surgery over 7.5 years

69 with anastomosis below 5cm

Median followup of 4.2 years: 

-3 pelvic recurrences
-No staple-line recurrence

## Dutch Trial

Dutch trial combined postoperative chemoRT and protocol-driven surgery using total mesorectal excision (TME)

Dutch Rectal Cancer Trial (CKVO 95-04): Demonstrated the benefit of preop radiation in combination with TME[@kapiteijn638]. Radiation reduced local recurrence form 10.9% to 5.6% without a change in overall survival

## German Trial

German Trial compared preoperative ChemoRT vs postoperative ChemoRT.  All patients received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy

## Short-course RT

An alternative to preoperative chemoradiation over 6 weeks is to administer radiation alone preoperative over a five day period.

Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial compared surgery alone with preoperative short-course therapy consisting of 5 doses of 500cGy of radiation without chemotherapy administered in one week prior to surgery. Local recurrence was 9% in the therapy group vs 26% in the control group, with an improvement in overall survival of 38% vs 80%[@swedishrectalcancertrial980]. Of note, this trial was performed in the era prior to the widespread use of total mesorectal excision.

## Stockholm III

Stockholm III trial showed that short-course radiation therapy performed 4-8 weeks prior to surgery resulted in improved rates of pathological complete response (12% vs 2%) compared with short-course radiation therapy performed the week prior to surgery [@pettersson972]

## Adjuvant Chemotherapy

Postoperative (adjuvant) chemotherapy was shown to be effective in reducing distant metastasis and improving survival in the ECORT 22921 clinical trial.

## Timing of Chemotherapy and ChemoRT

Adjuvant chemotherapy was traditionally given after surgery to patients with node-positive disease.  The surgical specimen was used to make decisions regarding postoperative chemotherapy

With the advent to preoperative chemoRT, the information derived from the surgical pathology specimen was no longer available, so all patients were given postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy

ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemotherapy

## Total Neoadjuvant Therapy

TNT approach moves all therapy to before surgery with goals to:

- Improve tolerance of chemotherapy
- Reduce toxicity of chemotherapy
- Improve compliance with chemotherapy
- Improve clinical complete response

## Total Neoadjuvant Therapy

TNT approach moves all therapy to before surgery with goals to:

- Improve tolerance of chemotherapy
- Reduce toxicity of chemotherapy
- Improve compliance with chemotherapy
- Improve clinical complete response
  $\rightarrow$ organ preservation


## RAPIDO Trial

RAPIDO trial randomized 920 patients with T4 or node-positive disease to long-course chemoradiation followed by surgery vs short-course radiation followed by chemotherapy and surgery. The pCR rate was significantly higher in the short course/chemotherapy/surgery group (28% vs 14%) and disease-specific surival at 3years was higher (30% vs 24%).[@bahadoer29] [@vandervalk75]

## PRODIGE-23 Trial

PRODIGE 23 randomized 461 patients with T3 or T4 recta cancers to long-course radiation followed by surgery vs induction chemotherapy, long-course radiation followed by surgery. Up-front chemotherapy was associates with increased 3-year survival (76% vs 69%) and an increase in rate of pathologic complete response of 28% vs 12%.[@conroy702]

## OPRA Clinical Trial

OPRA clinical trial [@garcia-aguilar2546]. 324 rectal cancer patients staged with MRI randomized to INCT (induction chemo followed by chemoRT) vs CNCT (Chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy). Patients with a response were offered watch and wait. Patients without a response were treated with surgery. No difference in disease-free survival or overall survival or metastasis-free survival. 304 patients were restaged and only 26% were recommended to have surgery. Among 225 patients in watch and wait, somewhat more patients with INCT had recurrences (40% of 105 = 42 patients vs 27% of 102 =32 patients). More organ preservation at 3 years with CNCT (60% CNCT vs 47% INCT).See also [@smith767]
