## Trans-abdominal Rectal Surgery

Trans-abdominal procedures include

-   Low anterior resection: Removal of the rectum with an anastomosis between colon and distal rectum
-   Hartmann resection: Removal of the rectum with end colostomy. The rectal stump is stapled. The anal sphincters are left in situ
-   Abdominoperineal resection: Removal of rectum and anus from both an abdominal and perineal approach. The anal sphincters are removed.

## Rectal Adjuvant Therapy

Surgery as sole treatment for rectal cancer is associated with an unacceptable rate of local recurrence. Accordingly, adjunctive stratagies were employed to reduce risk of local recurrence.

## GI Tumor Study Group 1985

227 rectal cancer patients with curative surgical resection:

\

-   58: Control with no further therapy
-   50: Postop radiation alone 4000 or 4800cGy
-   48: Postop chemotherapy 5FU+methyl-CCNU
-   46: Chemo + radiation

## GI Tumor Study Group 1985

Local Recurrence

-   55%: Control with no further therapy
-   50: Postop radiation alone 4000 or 4800cGy
-   48: Postop chemotherapy 5FU+methyl-CCNU
-   33%: Chemo + radiation

No difference in overall survival

## Total Mesorectal Excision

## Total Mesorectal Excicsion (1986)

115 rectal cancer patients underwent surgery over 7.5 years

69 with anastomosis below 5cm

Median followup of 4.2 years:

-   3 pelvic recurrences

-   No staple-line recurrence

## Dutch postop ChemoRT Trial

Dutch trial combined postoperative chemoRT and protocol-driven surgery using total mesorectal excision (TME)

Radiation reduced local recurrence form 10.9% to 5.6% without a change in overall survival

## Dutch Preop Short-course Trial


1861 patients randomized:

-   preop RT (5x 500cGy) $\rightarrow$ Surgery (TME)
-   Surgery alone (TME)

Reduction in local recurrence (2.4% vs 8.2%)

No difference in survival

## German Trial

German Trial compared preoperative ChemoRT vs postoperative ChemoRT. All patients received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy

Preoperative ChemoRT was superior in:

-   disease-free survival
-   treatment compliance
-   toxicity
-   sphincter preservation

## Short-course RT

Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial compared surgery alone with preoperative short-course therapy consisting of 5 doses of 500cGy of radiation without chemotherapy administered in one week prior to surgery. 

Local recurrence was 9% in the therapy group vs 26% in the control group

Overall survival at 5 years of 58% vs 48% (p=0.004) 

Disease-specific survival at 9 years 74% vs 65%. (p=0.002)

Of note, this trial was performed in the era prior to the widespread use of total mesorectal excision.

## Stockholm III

840 patients with rectal cancer randomized to preoperative radiation:

- Short course (5 x 5Gy) with surgery the following week
- Short course (5 x 5 Gy) with surgery 4- weeks later
- Long-course  (25 x 2Gy) with surgery 4-8 weeks later

With short-course radiation, elayed surgery resulted in higher rates of pCR (11.8% vs 1.7%)

## Adjuvant Chemotherapy

Postoperative (adjuvant) chemotherapy was shown to be effective in reducing distant metastasis and improving survival in the ECORT 22921 clinical trial.

## Timing of Chemotherapy and ChemoRT

Adjuvant chemotherapy was traditionally given after surgery to patients with node-positive disease. The surgical specimen was used to make decisions regarding postoperative chemotherapy

With the advent to preoperative chemoRT, the information derived from the surgical pathology specimen was no longer available, so all patients were given postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy

ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemotherapy

## Total Neoadjuvant Therapy

TNT approach moves all therapy to before surgery with goals to:

-   Improve tolerance of chemotherapy
-   Reduce toxicity of chemotherapy
-   Improve compliance with chemotherapy
-   Improve clinical complete response

## Total Neoadjuvant Therapy

TNT approach moves all therapy to before surgery with goals to:

-   Improve tolerance of chemotherapy
-   Reduce toxicity of chemotherapy
-   Improve compliance with chemotherapy
-   Improve clinical complete response $\rightarrow$ organ preservation

## RAPIDO Trial

RAPIDO trial randomized 920 patients with T4 or node-positive disease to long-course chemoradiation followed by surgery vs short-course radiation followed by chemotherapy and surgery. The pCR rate was significantly higher in the short course/chemotherapy/surgery group (28% vs 14%) and disease-specific surival at 3years was higher (30% vs 24%).[@bahadoer29] [@vandervalk75]

## PRODIGE-23 Trial

PRODIGE 23 randomized 461 patients with T3 or T4 rectal cancers:

Long-course radiation $\rightarrow$ surgery

Induction chemotherapy $\rightarrow$ Long-course radiation $\rightarrow$ surgery

-   Increased 3-year survival (76% vs 69%)

-   Increased pathologic complete response of 28% vs 12%

## Watchful Waiting

Retrospective studies demonstrated that among patients with a complete clinical response to chemoradiation for rectal cancer, some patients can be managed without surgery.

Subsequent trials of neoadjuvant therapy included non-operative management as a treatment option in patients with a complete clinical response to neoadjuvant therapy.
