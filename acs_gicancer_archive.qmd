Tracheoesophageal fistula in the context of esophageal cancer is most commonly due to squamous cell carcinoma. These patients need immediate consultation with thoracic surgery and interventional pulmonology.

# Gastric cancer with bleeding

# Gastric cancer with perforation

# Gastric outlet obstruction

# Appendectomy in the cancer patient

Non-operative paths

# Cholecystitis in the cancer patient

Wait for counts to come back? Percutaneous drainage? Med Once think it's always an emergency...

# Lymph node biossy

Who needs a core vs open biopsy?

# Vascular access in the cancer patient.

## Catheter-related bloodstream infections

# Bile duct obstruction from pancreatic cancer

Neutropenic patient with perirectal abscess - Percutaneous vs

LCI will do followup

First steps

Keep cases at Mercy and Pineville (don't all need to go to Main)

Red doesn't have time at Main in OR7

Ortho has been doing round trips to Mercy
