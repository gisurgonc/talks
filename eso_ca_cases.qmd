## T3 N0 M0 adenocarcinoma

Treatment Options - First Treatment Course

- [MI Esophagectomy]
- [Chemo + Radiation]
- [Chemotherapy]


## MI Esophagectomy

Correct answer, wrong timing

Why?

[T3 N0 M0 adenocarcinoma]


## Chemo + Radiation

Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery = Trimodality therapy

## CROSS Trial

-   368 esophageal cancer patients randomized:
    -   Surgery alone
    -   Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery
-   75% adenocarcinoma
-   T3: 80%. T2: 17%
-   age $\tilde{x}$=60
-   longer survival with Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery

CROSS Trial Details

Chemotherapy: Weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel Radiation: 4140 cGy in 23 fractions (180cGy/fraction)

## CROSS - Adenocarcinooma

Median survival 43mo vs 27mo

Pathologic complete response in 23%

## CROSS - Squamous cell carcinoma

Median survival 82mo vs 21mo

Pathologic complete response in 40%

::: aside
[@shapiro1090]
:::

## T3 N0 M0 Adenocarcinoma

Family asks if there is a better treatment option than CROSS

## Chemotherapy

"Sandwich" Chemotherapy may be superior to Trimodality therapy

## EsoPEC Trial

-   Adenocarcinoma esophagus - T1 N+ or T2-4a M0. Median age =63. 89% men

-   Randomized to CROSS (n=217) vs FLOT chemotherapy (n=221) = 438

-   CROSS: carboplatin/paclitaxel + 4140cGy $\rightarrow$ Surgery

-   FLOT: FLOT $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ FLOT

-   Excluded: Squamous cell, gastric cancer, T1N0, T4b, M1

## EsoPEC Trial Results

-   Surgery performed in 371/438 patients

-   90-day mortality 4.3% (3.2% in FLOT and 5.6% CROSS)

-   Median survival 66mo in FLOT arm and 37mo in Cross arm

-   3-year overall survival 57% FLOT vs 51% CROSS

-   5-year overall survival 51% FLOT vs 29% CROSS

-   pCR 17% for FLOT and 10% CROSS

## Surgery for Esophageal Cancer

Surgery for esophageal cancer is performed for:

-   Superficial Tumors (T1) not completely removed by endoscopy
-   Localized Tumors (T2N0)
-   Locally Advanced (T3) after preoperative therapy.

## Goals of Surgery

## Esophageal Cancer Treatment Categories

| Category             |   Stage    | Treatment                  |
|----------------------|:----------:|:---------------------------|
| [Dyplasia]           |    Tis     | Radiofrequency Ablation    |
| [Superficial Tumors] |    T1a     | Endoscopic Therapy         |

## Superficial Tumors

Workup of nodular Barretts:

-   Endoscopic Ultrasound
-   Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
    -   Diagnostic (T staging)
    -   May be therapeutic for T1a tumors

## Endoscopic Musocal Resection

![](images/EMR.jpg){fig-align="right"}

## Localized Tumors

Patients staged as uT2 N0 are candidates for primary surgery. *However:*

-   EUS has a 25% rate of understaging uT2 N0 tumors
-   Understaged patients who undergo primary surgery would need chemo or chemoRT postop

## Small Tumors (minimal dysphagia)

-   EUS to distinguish T2 from T3 tumors
-   If uT2 N0 $\rightarrow$ CT chest/abdomen/pelvis $\rightarrow$ Esophagectomy
-   If uT3 or N1 $\rightarrow$ PET $\rightarrow$ neoadjuvant therapy

Patients with dysphagia almost always are T3 tumors (and don't need EUS)

## Symptomatic Tumors (Dysphagia)

Patients with dysphagia to solids or weight loss or tumor length \>3cm are unlikely to have T1-2 tumors and can be initially evaluated with [PET Scan]

-   Disease confined to the esophagus and regional nodes $\rightarrow$ [Locally-advanced]
-   Metastatic disease $\rightarrow$ [Metastatic]
-   N3 $\rightarrow$ induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgical evaluation.

## EUS in Patients with Dysphagia

Memorial Sloan Kettering[^1] patients with esophageal cancer:

[^1]: @ripley226

-   61 with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors.
-   53 without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2 $\rightarrow$ candidates for primary surgery.

EUS can be omitted for patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients *without* dysphagia.

## PET Scan

PET has more specificity and sensitivity than CT in detecting regional lymph node and distal metastasis [^2]

[^2]: @block770

## Locally-advanced

For patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer, improved survival with adjunctive therapy. There are two options:

-   ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery ([CROSS Trial])
-   Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemo ([EsoPEC Trial])

## Surgery for Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the esophagus

- responds well to chemo+RT
- more difficul to get a surgical margin on the airway
- additional benefit of surgery on top of chemoRT is uncertain


## FFCD 9102 2007 (Bedenne)

All patients received 4500cGy RT + 2 cycles of cisplatin + 5FU

Patients with a clinical response were randomized:

-   Surgery -\> 2 year survival 34% Median 17.7mo

-   3 cycles of chemo + 2000 cGy RT -\> 2 year survival 40% Median 19.3mo

*No difference in overall survival* 

## German Trial (Stahl)

4000 cGY RT + Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery. 64% 2-year PFS. Mortality 12.8%

6500cGy RT + Chemo:  41% 2-year PFS. Mortality 3.5%

*No difference in overall survival* 

## Metastatic

FOLFOX is first-line systemic therapy for metastatic GI cancers

-   Dose-limiting toxicity is frequently peripheral neuropathy
