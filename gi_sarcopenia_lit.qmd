# Sarcopenia and mortality after GI Cancer Surgery

Eindhoven cancer registry. Esohpagectomy 90=day mortality 7.1% for \<65 years, 8.7% for 65-74 years, and 15.4% for 75+

Prognostic scales for cancer: France: [@canout-poitrine2236] 510 patients with cancer evaluated with multiple prognostic scales including CCI and Elixhauser. Only Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatics (CIR-G) was predictive of one-year mortality.

## Skeletal muscle density and frailty

Myosteatosis is defined as the infiltration of adipose tissue into skeletal muscle {Lenchik,opportunistic;Prado,135}

# Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT)

Among a group of 42 patiens underoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer, an elevated ratio of visceral adipose tissue to skeletal muscle as associated with postoperative complications.{sandini 1231}

Investigators at McMaster University examined 50 patients with pancreatic cancer and serially measured body skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue.Â  They found that survival was shorter in patients with more accelerated skeletal muscle loss as well as in those the loss of visceral adipose tissue. Similar findings were reported by Tan et al {Birdsell,6973}.

A Japanese study examined the predictive value of sarcopenia relative to anastomotic leak after esophagectomy {Tamandl, 2016 #2006}. \[??relation to VAT\] \*\*\* This paper is Tamadl 1359 related to overall survival.
