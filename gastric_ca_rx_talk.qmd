## Lymphadenectomy

Retrospective data from Japan in the 1980's suggested superior survival after extended lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer.

Extent of lympadenectomy can be categorized:

D1: Perigastric D2: Central nodes + splenic hilum D2$\alpha$: Central nodes D3: Extended nodes

## D1 Perigastric nodes

Lymph node stations immediately adjacent to the stomach

-   1:
-   2:
-   3: Lesser curvature
-   4: Greater curvature
-   5: Suprapyloric
-   6: Infrapyloric

## D1 Perigastric Nodes

## D2 Central Nodes + splenic hilum

Lymph nodes adjacent to celiac axis:

-   12a: Left side of porta hepatis
-   8: Common hepatic artery
-   7: Left gastric artery
-   9: Celiac axis
-   11: Proximal splenic artery
-   10: Splenic hilum

## D1$\alpha$ Central Nodes

Lymph nodes adjacent to celiac axis:

-   12a: Left side of porta hepatis
-   8: Common hepatic artery
-   7: Left gastric artery
-   9: Celiac axis
-   11: Proximal splenic artery
-   ~~10: Splenic hilum~~

## D2 Central Nodes

## Dutch Trial: D2 vs D1 

Operative mortality higher with D2 (10% vs 4%)

More complications wtih D2 (43% vs 25%)

More reoperations with D2 (18% vs 8%)

## Dutch Trial: Total vs Subtotal gastrectomy

Protocol did not dictate extend of gastric resection, but did require a proximal margin of 5cm if a subtotal gastrectomy performed.

No difference in survival between total vs subtotal gastrectomy

## Dutch Trial: Conclusions

D2 lymphadenectomy is associated with better local control of gastric cancer than D1 node dissection, but at an increased risk of mortality and complications.

Can the toxicity of extended lymphadenectomy be reduced?

- Elimination of splenectomy (D1$\alpha$)
- Mininally-invasive techniques

## HIPEC - Ongoing Trials

GASTRICHIP:

HIPEC + D2 gastrectomy +perioperative chemotherapy
vs
D2 gastrectomy + perioperative chemotherapy

## GASTRICHIP

105 patients randomized 2014 
Adult patients with GC and histologically proven PM were randomly assigned (1:1) to perioperative chemotherapy and CRS alone (CRS-A) or CRS plus HIPEC (CRS + H). HIPEC comprised mitomycin C 15 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 in 5 L of saline perfused for 60 minutes at 42°C. The primary end point was OS; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), other distant metastasis-free survival (MFS), and safety. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle.
Results

Between March 2014 and June 2018, 105 patients were randomly assigned (53 patients to CRS-A and 52 patients to CRS + H). The trial stopped prematurely because of slow recruitment. In 55 patients, treatment stopped before CRS mainly due to disease progression/death. Median OS was the same for both groups (CRS + H, 14.9 [97.2% CI, 8.7 to 17.7] months v CRS-A, 14.9 [97.2% CI, 7.0 to 19.4] months; P = .1647). The PFS was 3.5 months (95% CI, 3.0 to 7.0) in the CRS-A group and 7.1 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 10.5; P = .047) in the CRS + H group. The CRS + H group showed better MFS (10.2 months [95% CI, 7.7 to 14.7] v CRS-A, 9.2 months [95% CI, 6.8 to 11.5]; P = .0286). The incidence of grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) was similar between groups (CRS-A, 38.1% v CRS + H, 43.6%; P = .79).

There are multiple ongoing prospective trails exploring the utility of CRS + HIPEC in patients with PC from gastric and EGJ cancer. The GASTRICHIP study (NCT01882933) is randomizing patients to receive either HIPEC + D2 resection + perioperative chemotherapy or D2 resection + perioperative chemotherapy.76 The PERIOSCOPE-II trial (NCT03348150) aims to compare CRS + HIPEC to systemic chemotherapy in patients with PC from gastric cancer.77 The phase 3 CHIMERA trial (NCT04597294) is comparing FLOT + HIPEC to FLOT + surgery to evaluate the efficacy of HIPEC in patients with advanced gastric cancer.78 The PREVENT trial (NCT04447352) is a phase 3 randomized control trial exploring the use of preventive HIPEC + perioperative FLOT versus FLOT alone for diffuse type gastric and junctional cancer.79 Diffuse type gastric cancer is associated with a higher risk of PC than intestinal gastric cancer. If this intervention proves effective, it could potentially result in a new standard of therapy for diffuse type gastric cancer. Chemotherapy
