The early recovery group had fewer pulmonary complications (17% vs 33%) and fewer overall complications (33% vs 52%). No difference in anastomotic leakage (12% vs 16%). No difference in length of stay or pain scores(Shen et al. 2022).\nMeta-analysis (Pisarska et al. 2017), included 2042 patients (1058 in an ERAS group vs 984 in a traditional group), revealed a significantly shorter hospital stay and fewer non-surgical and pulmonary complications in the ERAS group, but no effect on overall morbidity, mortality or readmission rates.\nMeta-analysis of 13 reports of enhanced recovery protocols performed a regression analysis to identify factors which may be important in length of stay reductions. These factors included immediate extubation, early gastrograffin study, early urinary catheter removal, early feeding with at least sips of water on the first postoperative day, early enteral feeding, and epidural catheter removal within 4 days(S. R. Markar et al. 2017).\nVirginia Mason ERAS (Schmidt et al. 2016)\n\n\n\nPatients with esophageal cancer frequently suffer from undernutrition due to GI tract obstruction and the pro-inflammatory effects of cancer and the effects of neoadjuvant therapy.

Gastrostomy placement, particularly via the endoscopic approach (PEG) runs the risk of damage to the right gastroepiploic vascular arcade, which might devascularize a future gastric conduit(Ohnmacht et al. 2006), although small series suggest that this risk is low (Margolis et al. 2003).\nA meta-analysis of over 1000 patients treated with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy prior to esophagectomy found no differences in anastomtic leak rate and no instances of conduit failure due to PEG placement (Fang et al. 2022)\nAnecdotal data suggests that esophagectommy with gastric conduit can safely be performed after gastrostomy, particularly if placement is done via laparoscopy and if the tube can be removed prior to esophagectomy to allow the tract to heal.

Preliminary results from a recently concluded study [24] on prehabilitation for esophageal surgery demonstrated improvement in functional capacity; however, the impact on postoperative outcomes needs to be evaluated by further ongoing studies [25]. Extrapolation from studies on other abdominal surgeries [20] suggests that at least 4 weeks of preoperative prehabilitation is better than postoperative rehabilitation to influence outcomes. As most patients with operable esophageal cancer would receive neoadjuvant treatment, it would be opportunistic to use this preoperative window to initiate prehabilitation.\nA feasibility trial of prehabilitation before oesophagogastric cancer surgery using a multi-component home-based exercise programme: the ChemoFit study.(Chmelo et al. 2022)\nThe Role of Prehabilitation in Modern Esophagogastric Cancer Surgery: A Comprehensive Review.(Bausys et al. 2022)\nPrehab (Gillis et al. 2018)"

As most patients with operable esophageal cancer would receive neoadjuvant treatment, it would be opportunistic to use this preoperative window to initiate prehabilitation.\nA feasibility trial of prehabilitation before oesophagogastric cancer surgery using a multi-component home-based exercise programme: the ChemoFit study.(Chmelo et al. 2022)\nThe Role of Prehabilitation in Modern Esophagogastric Cancer Surgery: A Comprehensive Review.(Bausys et al. 2022)\nPrehab (Gillis et al. 2018)"

The early feeding group had shorter length of stay (8 vs 10 days) and shorter time to functional recovery (7 vs 9 days)(Fransen et al. 2022).\nDiabetic management with feeding jejunostomy\nIntraoperative hypothermia is associated with increased risk of postoperative infections.

    "text": "Cancer cachexia is characterized by significant weight loss and muscle wasting. It is often accompanied by weakness, fatigue, and a loss of appetite. Cancer cachexia is a complex and multifactorial syndrome that is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including the cancer itself, the cancer treatment, and the body’s response to the cancer. Cancer cachexia can have a significant impact on a person’s quality of life and is associated with a poor prognosis.\nInternational consensus (Fearon et al., 2011) defined cancer cachexia as being characterized by a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass,with or without loss of adipose mass. This cachexia cannotbe fully supported by conventional nutritional support and gradually leads to functional impairment. It has been described as a continuum with three stages of diagnosis: pre‐cachexia, cachexia, and refractory cachexia.\nFearon: Three-factor model with weight loss &gt;10%, low food intake (&lt;1500kcal/day) and systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein &gt;10mg/l) (fearon?). All three factors required.\nValidation of cachexia definition: (Blum et al., 2014). Proposed a four-group classification model, which required use of CRP. PS-SGA and Edmonton Symptom Assessment System. Four group classification did not distinguish better than two group.\nReview: Cachexia and sarcopenia (Dolly et al., 2020)\nCachexia Score (CASCO): body weight and lean body mass loss; anorexia; infmallation, immunologic and metabolic disturbances; physical performance and quality of life\n\n\n\nThe cancer itself: Some types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer, are more likely to cause cachexia than others. The presence of certain types of cancer cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages, may also contribute to the development of cachexia.\nThe body’s response to the cancer: The body’s immune system may produce certain hormones and cytokines in response to the cancer, which can lead to inflammation and weight loss.\nCancer treatment: Some cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can cause side effects that lead to weight loss and muscle wasting.\nNutritional factors: People with cancer may have difficulty getting enough nutrients due to a lack of appetite, difficulty swallowing, or other factors.\nPsychological factors: Depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions that are common in people with cancer may contribute to weight loss and muscle wasting, particularly through inactivity"

Domain-specific cutoffs were used in accordance with prior literature.21, 23-25 Frailty was reported using the CARE Frailty Index based on the principles of deficit accumulation, as previously published.26, 27 In brief, the CARE Frailty Index includes 44 geriatric assessment variables identified as health deficits from the CARE survey, each of which is scored as 0 (no deficit) or 1 (deficit present) (see Supporting Methods). These values were then combined and divided by the overall number of deficits assessed (range, 0-1) and categorized as robust (0-0.2), prefrail (0.2-0.35), and frail (&gt;0.35).26 In addition, the CARE survey incorporates the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 10-item global health questionnaire to assess HRQoL, which includes physical and mental health subscales.28, 29\nPrognostic scales for cancer: France: (Canoui-Poitrine et al. 2022) 510 patients with cancer evaluated with multiple prognostic scales including CCI and Elixhauser.

    "text": "CARE Survey\nCARE survey is a modified version of the original Cancer and Aging Research Group geriatric assessment, augmented to streamline completion and to aid integration into routine oncologic clinical practice. The CARE survey measures activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs (iADLs), the ability to walk 1 block, the number of falls within 6 months, nutrition, comorbid conditions, cognitive complaints, anxiety, depression, social support, social activities, and self-rated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. Domain-specific cutoffs were used in accordance with prior literature.21, 23-25 Frailty was reported using the CARE Frailty Index based on the principles of deficit accumulation, as previously published.26, 27 In brief, the CARE Frailty Index includes 44 geriatric assessment variables identified as health deficits from the CARE survey, each of which is scored as 0 (no deficit) or 1 (deficit present) (see Supporting Methods). These values were then combined and divided by the overall number of deficits assessed (range, 0-1) and categorized as robust (0-0.2), prefrail (0.2-0.35), and frail (&gt;0.35).26 In addition, the CARE survey incorporates the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 10-item global health questionnaire to assess HRQoL, which includes physical and mental health subscales.28, 29\nPrognostic scales for cancer: France: (Canoui-Poitrine et al. 2022) 510 patients with cancer evaluated with multiple prognostic scales including CCI and Elixhauser.

Seventy-six percent of patients (42/55) had ≥1 genomic alteration [including variants of unknown significance (VUS)] and 69.1% (38/55) had ≥1 characterized alteration (excluding VUSs). The median number of alterations per patient was 2 (range, 0–15). TP53 (50.9%, 28/55), PIK3CA (16.4%, 9/55), ERBB2 (14.5%, 8/55), and KRAS (14.5%, 8/55) genes were most frequently affected characterized alterations. Thirty-one patients also had tissue NGS. Concordance between tissue and ctDNA ranged from 61.3% (TP53 alterations) to 87.1% (KRAS alterations).

In this cohort, 125 patients with stage I–III oesophagogastric cancers were analysed at any timepoint postoperatively (regardless of adjuvant treatment). The median recurrence-free survival was not reached in patients negative for ctDNA, whereas it was 9·6 months in patients positive for ctDNA (HR 23·6, 95% CI 10·2–66·0; p=0·0001).72 These results were observed irrespective of the anatomical localisation of the tumour.

Threshold values determined for optimal stratification (cf (Martin et al., 2013; prado639?)\nLow muscle mass has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis cancer patients.(Martin et al., 2013) This may be due to overal frailty or low muscle mass may lead to increased toxicity from chemotherapy due to pharmacokinetic mechanism. 5-FU is hydrophilic and it volume of distribution includes the muscle compartment, while oxaliplatin is hydrophobic, with distribution in the fat compartment(Bozzetti, 2017).\nIn addition, loss of muscle mass during chemotherapy for advanced cancers is a poor prognosticator.\nBlauhoff (Blauwhoff-Buskermolen et al., 2016) studis 67 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Muscle area on CT decreased by 6.1% over 3 months. Patients in the lowest tertile (loss of 9%) had worse survial. Overall survival 17.5 months for first-line chemotherapy and 8.5months for second-line. Baseline muscle density was predictive of survival on multivariable analysis, but low SMI at baseline was not associatesd with survival. (This may be because sarcopenic obesity is the major risk factor, and there were few obese patients in the study cohort) &gt;Muscle loss of 9% or more remained independently associated with survival when adjusted for sex, age, baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, comorbidity, mono-organ or multiorgan metastases, treatment line, and tumor progression at first evaluation by computed tomography scan (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.21 to 9.05; P , .001). We found a mean coefficient of variation between observers of 0.6% for skeletal muscle area in a random sample of 20 patients, which is regarded to be low.(MacDonald et al., 2011). Changes between the first and second scans were calculated as a rate of change per 3 months, meaning change per first evaluation, to compare with available literature.[awad74][prado1583]Relative muscle change per 3 months was categorized into tertiles of muscle change: tertile one, highest muscle loss up to 9%; tertile two, muscle loss of 9% to 1.5%; and tertile three, muscle loss of 1.5% until highest gain in muscle. However, the survival curve of tertile two was not significantly different from the survival curve of tertile three (log-rank P = .961); therefore tertiles two and three were pooled (cutoff, 9% muscle loss).\nKurk (Kurk et al., 2020) found that skeletal muscle loss during chemotherapy was associated with decreased progression-free and overall- survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nDetailed changes in skeletal muscle mass and body weight during CAIRO3 treatments were previously reported.KurkS, p909, 2018) We additionally analyzed changes in SMI and BMI during these treatments by linear mixed effects models.(Bayar MA,p311,2017) The baseline value of the outcome (SMI/BMI) was included in the outcome vector. Potential confounders were age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, best response to initial six cycles CAPOX‐B, resection of the primary tumor, and the number of metastatic sites. The final model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and included: treatment arm, time, age, sex, resection primary tumor, and the interaction of treatment arm by time as fixed effects. Modeling time as a random effect did not increase the model fit as indicated by the AIC. To investigate differences in SMI and BMI changes over time between the CAIRO3 treatment arms, we checked the significance of the two‐way interaction including treatment arm by time.\n\n\nDuring p2 (maintenance CAP‐B/observation), again absolute SMI and BMI at the start (t1) of treatment were not associated with early progression and death. In contrast, SMI loss and BMI loss during treatment were associated with early progression and death.\n\nFogelman (Fogelman et al., 2014) treated patients undergoing chemotherapy with a novel agent designed to reduce muscle less. CT scans at 2 months were compared with baseline scans prior to chemotherapy.\n\nChanges in skeletal muscle were determined using routinely acquired CT scans for patients on the study. We calculated skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). A single slice at the mid-point of L3 was used, preferably a 2.5-mm slice if available, and a 5-mm slice if a 2.5-mm slice was not available. The L3 is a landmark that has been extensively used and validated in studies assessing body composition in cancer patients [Shen et al. (2004)](Prado et al., 2009) . Skeletal muscle surface areas were determined using Slice-o-Matic softwareTM, version 4.3 (Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada) using pre-established thresholds of Hounsfield units (HU) of −29 to +150 (Mitsiopoulos et al., 1998). We additionally evaluated adipose tissue cross-sectional area (subcutaneous, visceral, and intramuscular) in the L3 region as described previously (Mourtzakis et al., 2008). Changes in muscle and adipose tissue surface areas over time were determined for each patient from the baseline study to the first CT post treatment, done after 2 months. We looked at muscle loss as a continuous variable and defined “meaningful loss” as greater than a 6 cm2 difference from the baseline to the second scan. We chose this cut point as it is equivalent to 1 kg of skeletal muscle and is associated with physical function (i.e., muscle strength). Additionally, this cut point has been used to investigate significant changes in muscle mass throughout cancer disease trajectory [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al., 1988)(Prado et al., 2013).\n\nPrado (Prado et al., 2013) looked at changes in 1279 CT scans in 368 patients with advanced cancer. The last available interval with CT scans was chosen for comparison. Categorized into stable, gaining, losing for muscle and for adipose tissue. Adipose tissue was ?? sum of visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous tissue. (Did not use SMI). Muscel loss and adipose loss seemed correlated, with larger magnitude of adipose tissue loss at short interval to death. (Authors conclusion that muscle and adipose tissue loss in the past 3 months of life is likely not possible) &gt;Advanced-cancer patients (n = 368; median survival: 196 d) had a total of 1279 CT images over the course of their disease. With consideration of all time points, muscle loss occurred in 39% of intervals between any 2 scans. However, the overall frequency of muscle gain was 15.4%, and muscle was stable in 45.6% of intervals between any 2 scans, which made the maintenance or gain of muscle the predominant behavior. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that being within 90 d (compared with &gt;90 d) from death was the principal risk factor for muscle loss (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.94; P = 0.002), and muscle gain was correspondingly less likely (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.69; P = 0.002) at this time. Sex, age, BMI, and tumor group were not significant predictors of muscle loss or gain. A much higher proportion of men (61%) than women (31%) met the criteria for sarcopenia. Changes in muscle and adipose tissue over time were calculated as the absolute loss or gain of tissue area during each scan interval. The precision error of measurements was ~1.5% (Mourtzakis et al., 2008) with a minimum detectable change of ~3 cm2. We attributed the change during each interval into the following categories: 1) muscle loss ≥6.0 cm2, 2) stable muscle ±5.9 cm2, or 3) muscle gain ≥6.0cm2. These cutoffs are equivalent to a loss or gain of ≥1 kg of skeletal muscle on a whole-body basis and are associated with alterations in muscle strength [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al., 1988). For adipose tissue, categories were based on the equivalence of 14.7 cm2 total fat at L3 and 1 kg tissue on a whole-body basis (Shen et al., 2004); therefore, changes during each interval were categorized as 1) adipose tissue loss ≥14.7 cm2, 2) stable adipose tissue ±14.6 cm2, or 3) adipose tissue gain ≥14.7 cm2. CT scans were taken for the diagnosis, confirmation of stage, and follow-up of disease progression and treatment. With the understanding that cachexia evolves markedly in the end of life and to take advantage of repeated measures, we focused on patients with ≥2 CT images (2–6 images) on record during the year preceding their deaths (n = 368). A selection bias was not apparent in this sample; we showed that the sex distribution, age at death, survival time, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, and body-composition features (ie, muscle and adipose tissues) in patients who had only a single scan were not different from those of the overall cohort at an equal time to death (P &gt; 0.1). Patients included in the analysis (n = 368) were of advanced stage, and the median time to death of all groups was &lt;1 y.\nLieffers and advanced colorectal cancer: Found liver and spleen increased in size in terminal patients (causing increase in basal metabolic rate). Found more rapid muscle loss with progressive disease (Lieffers et al., 2009). Different thresholds for VAT (-150 to -50) and SAT(-190 to -30). Also estimated muscel surface area using measurements 5cm above L4(Shen et al., 2004). Most rapid change in body composition between 4 months and 1 month prior to death. &gt;14% of patients gained skeletal muscle during the year preceding death from colorectal cancer (+4.7 ± 5.4%/100 d)."

CT scan at L3 was analyed to determine SMI,IMAT,VAT,SAT and TAT (=VAT+SAT+IMAT) using SliceOMatic. Threshold values determined for optimal stratification (cf (Martin et al., 2013; prado639?)\nLow muscle mass has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis cancer patients.(Martin et al., 2013) This may be due to overal frailty or low muscle mass may lead to increased toxicity from chemotherapy due to pharmacokinetic mechanism. 5-FU is hydrophilic and it volume of distribution includes the muscle compartment, while oxaliplatin is hydrophobic, with distribution in the fat compartment(Bozzetti, 2017).\nIn addition, loss of muscle mass during chemotherapy for advanced cancers is a poor prognosticator.\nBlauhoff (Blauwhoff-Buskermolen et al., 2016) studis 67 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Muscle area on CT decreased by 6.1% over 3 months. Patients in the lowest tertile (loss of 9%) had worse survial. Overall survival 17.5 months for first-line chemotherapy and 8.5months for second-line. Baseline muscle density was predictive of survival on multivariable analysis, but low SMI at baseline was not associatesd with survival. (This may be because sarcopenic obesity is the major risk factor, and there were few obese patients in the study cohort) &gt;Muscle loss of 9% or more remained independently associated with survival when adjusted for sex, age, baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, comorbidity, mono-organ or multiorgan metastases, treatment line, and tumor progression at first evaluation by computed tomography scan (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.21 to 9.05; P , .001). We found a mean coefficient of variation between observers of 0.6% for skeletal muscle area in a random sample of 20 patients, which is regarded to be low.(MacDonald et al., 2011). Changes between the first and second scans were calculated as a rate of change per 3 months, meaning change per first evaluation, to compare with available literature.[awad74][prado1583]Relative muscle change per 3 months was categorized into tertiles of muscle change: tertile one, highest muscle loss up to 9%; tertile two, muscle loss of 9% to 1.5%; and tertile three, muscle loss of 1.5% until highest gain in muscle. However, the survival curve of tertile two was not significantly different from the survival curve of tertile three (log-rank P = .961); therefore tertiles two and three were pooled (cutoff, 9% muscle loss).\nKurk (Kurk et al., 2020) found that skeletal muscle loss during chemotherapy was associated with decreased progression-free and overall- survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nDetailed changes in skeletal muscle mass and body weight during CAIRO3 treatments were previously reported.KurkS, p909, 2018) We additionally analyzed changes in SMI and BMI during these treatments by linear mixed effects models.(Bayar MA,p311,2017) The baseline value of the outcome (SMI/BMI) was included in the outcome vector. Potential confounders were age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, best response to initial six cycles CAPOX‐B, resection of the primary tumor, and the number of metastatic sites. The final model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and included: treatment arm, time, age, sex, resection primary tumor, and the interaction of treatment arm by time as fixed effects. Modeling time as a random effect did not increase the model fit as indicated by the AIC. To investigate differences in SMI and BMI changes over time between the CAIRO3 treatment arms, we checked the significance of the two‐way interaction including treatment arm by time.\n\n\nDuring p2 (maintenance CAP‐B/observation), again absolute SMI and BMI at the start (t1) of treatment were not associated with early progression and death. In contrast, SMI loss and BMI loss during treatment were associated with early progression and death.\n\nFogelman (Fogelman et al., 2014) treated patients undergoing chemotherapy with a novel agent designed to reduce muscle less. CT scans at 2 months were compared with baseline scans prior to chemotherapy.\n\nChanges in skeletal muscle were determined using routinely acquired CT scans for patients on the study. We calculated skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3).

Arm 3 (da Vinci 8 mm, R3) is positioned on the left mid-clavicular line (MCL) at least 8 cm away from R2 on a straight line, followed by the fourth arm (da Vinci 8 mm, R4) as far left lateral from R3 as possible. Arm 1 (da Vinci 8 mm, R1) is placed on right MCL at least 8 cm away from R2. Depending on the use of the EndoWrist® stapler, either a da Vinci 13-mm port or a standard da Vinci 8-mm port is used (if laparoscopic stapling is through a 12-mm assistant port). A 12-mm assistant port is triangulated midway inferior between R3 and R4. If a laparoscopic stapler is used, R1 (da Vinci 8 mm) is placed as lateral as possible on the right, 2–3 cm superior to the arm 2 port and at least 8 cm away from a 12-mm assistant port (A) used for the laparoscopic stapling. The assistant port (A) is then moved to the location of R1 (Fig. 3a). For liver retraction (LR), a 5-mm port is placed either subcostally on the right MCL (retraction with a laparoscopic grasper) or subxiphiodal for a Nathanson retractor\nThoracic Phase Single lung ventilation is induced and moderate CO2 insufflation of ~ 8 mmHg is applied, creating the surgical workspace in the thorax. The ports are placed as follows: R4 (da Vinci 8 mm port) in the 4th intercostal space (ICS), 1 cm medial to the scapula; R3 (da Vinci 8 mm port) in the 6th ICS, slightly more medial than port 4; R2 (da Vinci 8 mm port) in the 8th ICS at the same level as port 4; R1 (da Vinci 13 mm port) on the scapular line or slightly posterior in the 10th ICS. A 6–10cm spacing is maintained between ports. This port is used for the EndoWrist® Stapler (if a laparoscopic stapler is used, a da Vinci 8-mm port is adequate). There are two recommended options for the assistant port (12 mm (A)) location, depending on surgeon’s preference for the introduction of the circular stapler to construct the oesophagogastrostomy. (A)1 is in the 9th ICS, triangulated between R1 and R2; this would be the site for specimen removal and entrance of circular stapler. Alternatively, (A)2 is triangulated between R3 and R4 in the 5th ICS. The assistant port might be enlarged to a minithoracotomy (~ 3–5 cm) with a size Bsmall^ or Bx-small^ Alexis Wound Retractor (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) placed here. This would be the site for specimen removal and entrance of the circular stapler (Fig. 3b).\nLiver Retraction Utilising a method for static retraction allows all da Vinci instrument arms to be free for dynamic use and localised static retraction where necessary. There are two different options to retract the liver with a Bstatic system^: the placement of a long bariatric grasper through a 5-mm port in the right flank to lift up the right hepatic lobe (using locking bariatric grasper to Block^ grips on the right crus for static retraction of liver) or a Nathanson Liver Retractor (Cook Medical, Limerick, Ireland). Gastric and Distal Oesophagus Mobilisation The dissection begins by opening the gastro-hepatic ligament close to the liver and up to the right crus of the diaphragm, after evaluation of an aberrant left gastric artery. The common hepatic artery is identified, followed by lymph node dissection of its upper margin up to the celiac axis. The right gastric artery is preserved. The DII lymphadenectomy is then completed to the area of the coelic trunk and splenic and left gastric artery. The left gastric artery and the atrial coronary vein are ligated using a Large or Medium-Large Clip in R3. The gastric mobilisation follows a medial to lateral approach. The gastric fundus is lifted up with the forceps in the secondary arm on the right (R4) to expose the oesophageal hiatus, right and left crura, and the lesser sac. Care should be taken if a posterior gastric artery is encountered. The retro-gastric adhesions, as well as the short gastric arteries, can be dissected and ligated safely with the EndoWrist Vessel Sealer or Harmonic ACE. The hiatus is dissected and, if necessary, widened by severing the right crus of the diaphragm. By doing so, the oesophagus can be released circumferentially and mobilised high into the mediastinal cavity, which leads to a less challenging dissection of the greater gastric curvature and conservation of the right gastroepiploic arcade by fully dissecting the gastrocolic ligament. The fundus of the stomach is elevated with R4, while the bedside assistant elevates the stomach by lifting the antrum. The large curvature of the stomach is mobilised by dissecting the gastrocolic ligament from caudal to cranial, preserving the right gastroepiploic vascular arcade. Gastric Tube Construction The construction of the gastric tube starts at the pyloric antrum. A stomach tube on the site of the greater curvature (5 cm diameter) is formed. To approximate the diameter of the gastric tube, either the Cadiere Forceps (grasping tip length 20 mm) or the Tip-Up Fenestrated Grasper (grasping tip length 32 mm) can be held up against the gastric conduit. The stomach is carefully elongated with the EndoWrist instruments. The stomach tube is only partially created in the abdominal cavity. For this, the stomach is stapled using only 3–5 45- or 60-mm stapler magazines to create the initial part of the tube, with a remnant stomach left to subsequently introduce the circular stapler (Fig. 4a). Surgical Steps, Thoracic Phase Dissection of the Oesophagus Depending on the location of the tumour, the dissection usually removes all tissues superiorly along the pericardium from the level of the hiatus and inferior vena cava to the carina, lower trachea and right main bronchus, posteriorly along the length of the thoracic aorta, and laterally along the pleural surfaces. Therefore, the dissection plane is according to the described meso-oesophagus—defined by the adventitia of the aorta, mediastinal pleura with view of the ventilated left lung, and the pericardium.9 If the dissection level cannot be kept clear due to the assumed tumour extension or preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, an extension of the resection level is possible with removal of the mediastinal pleura and/or pericardium. The oesophagus is transected slightly above the level of the usually ligated azygos vein with a linear stapler and is then cranially separated from it with scissors so that a frozen section can be obtained from the oral resection. Stomach Pull-up This manoeuvre should be done with extreme caution due to the risk of damaging the fragile gastric tube. The patient-side assistant should support the pull-up with laparoscopic graspers. Special attention is given to not twisting it by keeping the gastroepiploic arcade dorsally. The stomach is pulled into the thorax through the extended hiatus until the area of the unfinished gastric tube at the remnant stomach is comfortably located in the middle of the right thoracic cavity. This ensures that the maximum available length of the stomach tube is utilized Circular Stapled Anastomosis The circular stapler anvil (a 28/29-mm sized circular stapler device with a long handle is recommended) is inserted transthoracically through the Alexis wound retractor into the oesophageal stump and secured with a purse-string suture constructed, for example, using a StratafixTM Spiral® PDS 3-0, SH needle, 15 cm length or Prolene 2/0 (Fig. 5a). The intact minor gastric curvature of the transected specimen is brought out of the chest through the mini-thoracotomy. The circular stapler handle is then introduced into the stomach conduit via an incision in the minor curvature (Fig. 4b), and the best position for the anastomosis near the greater curvature of the conduit is chosen. The camera might be positioned in Trocar 1 for this manoeuvre to have a superior overview. The perfusion of the gastric conduit can also be checked again for confirmation with indocyanine green (Fig. 5b, c). The gastric conduit is then straightened by the assistant and stapled to the oesophageal stump. Next, a bougie is inserted past the anastomosis into the gastric conduit, to prevent narrowing of the proximal conduit during the subsequent specimen transection. The remaining gastric part with the oesophageal specimen attached is transected with a linear stapler (Figs. 4c and 5d) and removed through the mini-thoracotomy. In the case of a widely opened hiatus, a fixation suture can be applied to the hiatus to avoid possible herniation. Due to the mobility of the instruments, this is easily possible with the robot.\nGrimminger PP, Hadzijusufovic E, Lang H: Robotic-Assisted Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy (RAMIE) with a Standardized Intrathoracic Circular End-to-side Stapled Anastomosis and a Team of Two (Surgeon and Assistant Only).

The resection specimen is removed through a minithoracotomy at the level of the 6th intercostal space, and Fig. 4 Left lateral decubitus position Fig. 5 Thoracic trocar placement through this minithoracotomy, it is also possible to create a video-assisted anastomosis. In both colorectal and thoracic surgery, we are using the FireflyTM fluorescence imaging as mentioned above. With the help of the system, we can control the blood circulation of the organ and this helps us to define the resection margin. Circulation is controlled before and after anastomosis has been performed. In one patient, we performed a hand-sewn (robot-sewn) end-to-end double-layer anastomosis with a continuous 3–0 V-LocTM suture. Anastomosis of the other ten patients was performed with the EEATM OrVilTM device (end-to-side anastomosis) with additional circular suturing of the anastomosis with a 3–0 V-LocTM.\n\n\n\nItaly (Huscher et al., 2023) 40 patients over 4 years\nAll patients underwent a fast-track surgical protocol. The Da Vinci ® Si robotic system was positioned perpendicular to the patient’s right side and docked to the trocars. For the abdominal part of the procedure, the patient was positioned in a supine position. The four robotic trocars were placed in a horizontal line at or above the umbilicus (Fig. 1). In the abdomen, CO2 insufflation with 14 mmHg of pressure was used. Targeting to the stomach was performed. The surgical assistant was located on the left side of the table. A tip-up fenestrated grasper in trocar 1 was used to elevate the left lobe of the liver and for certain retraction movements during the abdominal part. The fenestrated bipolar forceps were used in the 12-mm trocar (no. 2) with a reduction cartridge, and later the 12-mm trocar was used for the robotic Endo Wrist ® stapler 45 mm to form the gastric conduit, beginning from the lesser curvature near the crow foot and continued towards the fundus, parallel to the greater curvature. After the abdominal dissection and creation of the conduit for reconstruction, Indocyanine Green (ICG) test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of the gastric conduit. For the thoracic part of the procedure (Fig. 2), the patient was positioned in a prone position (the operation table was tilted 19° towards the prone) and three robotic trocars and one laparoscopic trocar were inserted on the right chest. A single-lumen tube was used for intubation and the right lung was not deflated and disconnected from ventilation. In the chest, CO2 insufflation with 8 mmHg of pressure was enough to obtain an optimal working volume. The pulmonary ligament was divided. Hereafter, the parietal pleura was dissected at the anterior side of the esophagus from the diaphragm, up to the azygos vein. The azygos vein was ligated with Hem-o-lok and divided. At the posterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is dissected cranially to caudally along the azygos vein, including the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct was clipped with a 10-mm endoclip. To facilitate esophagus mobilization, a Penrose drain was placed around the esophagus to manipulate the esophagus for further mobilization. The thoracic esophagus was mobilized and transected at the level of the azygos vein. The esophagus was resected en bloc with the surrounding mediastinal lymph nodes. The resected specimen will contain right-side paratracheal (station 2R), tracheobronchial (station 4), aortopulmonary window (station 5), carinal (station 7), and periesophageal (station 8) lymph nodes. The reconstruction time started with the anchoring of the gastric conduit to the esophageal stump with two 3–0 silk stay sutures. The conduit was opened on the anterior wall by the adoption of a monopolar hook. An end-to-side roboticsewn anastomosis was created by the adoption of two 3–0 running barbed sutures (V-loc – Medtronic, USA – Fig. 3).11, 12 After completion of the anterior wall, a nasogastric tube was passed through the half-completed anastomosis. Once the anastomosis was completed, 3–0 silk interrupted sutures were placed circumferentially to reinforce it (Fig. 4; Video). Before and after anastomosis fashioning, an ICG test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of conduit. In addition, the conduit cul-de-sac was suspended at the posterior thoracic wall by two stitches. The specimen was extracted through a small thoracotomy and a right-sided chest tube was placed. No postoperative swallow tests were performed. In the absence of clinical signs of anastomotic dehiscence (for example, luminal contents through the drain or wound site/local inflammation; fever (&gt; 38 °C) or leukocytosis (&gt; 10,000/L); leak may also be detected on imaging studies), patients started with sips of water at the day 3 and the oral intake was gradually increased to solid food. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines were used in the postoperative protocol.\nLeak rate 4/40 = 10%\nStricture 10/40 = 25%\nItaly 30 patients (Marano et al., 2023)\nSingle‐lung ventilation is introduced, and the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, tilted 45° compared to the prone position. For both robotic systems, the cart is docked from the right side of the patient. In addition, three robotic ports are put in place as well as two thoracoscopic ports for the assistant. dV®SiTM port layout for this stage has previously been described [24]. It’s worthy of mention that an additional 5 mm port for the assistant is placed between the intercostal spaces (ICS) 6 and 10, along the posterior axillary line. Figure 2 shows the dV®XiTM trocar position (three-arms technique) in a slight U shape: robotic arm#1(R1) for the grasper or the bipolar forceps at the ICS 9, robotic arm#2 (R2) for the 30° down scope at the ICS 6, posterior to the posterior axillary line and robotic arm#3 (R3) for the monopolar cautery hook, the needle driver or the clip applier at the ICS 4, anterior to the scapular rim. Furthermore assistant port #1(A1, 12-mm) is located in the ILC 8, and assistant port #2 (A2, 5 mm) between R2 and R3 at the posterior axillary line. The targeting area is identified at the level of the Azygos arch. A 7–8 mmHg pneumothorax is then induced. Starting at the anterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is cut from the level of the azygos arch down to the diaphragm where the pulmonary ligament is divided. The azygos arch is then sectioned with robotic Weck Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) and a right paratracheal lymphadenectomy is performed. Next, the dissection of the parietal pleura is deepened towards the esophageal hiatus until the aorta becomes exposed. Subsequently, the right vagus nerve is sectioned just below the carina, preserving its bronchial branches. The dissection of the esophagus is extended below the tracheal bifurcation and a Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus to facilitate traction.\nThe dissection of the esophagus is then continued along the pericardium down to the diaphragm and the thoracic duct is clipped with robotic clips. The resection of the esophagus en-bloc with periesophageal, bronchial and subcarinal nodes (stations # 107–111) and the thoracic duct is fully completed from the diaphragm up to the azygos arch. The proximal esophagus is divided using a robotic cautery hook above the level of the azygos vein. At this point, the instruments in R1 and R3 are reversed to be able to carefully pull the esophago-gastric bloc and the gastric conduit up through the hiatus until the marker suture becomes visible. The specimen and conduit thus are disconnected, and the specimen is placed in a plastic bag which will be removed through the enlarged incision of the assistant port. Thereafter, four supportive 4-0 polyglactin 910 (Ethicon Inc. USA) stitches are put in between the mucosae and the muscularis externa layer of the esophagus at the four cardinal points to evert the esophageal mucosae. Next, the proximal esophagus is dilatated using a Foley catheter inflated with 10 cc of sterile water for approximately 2–3 min. After having assessed both gastric conduit and esophageal perfusion with ICG fluorescence, a gastrotomy is performed at the most proximal portion of the conduit, maintaining at least 2 cm of distance from the stapler line. A single-layer robot-sewn esophagogastric anastomosis is performed above the level of the azygos arch with two separate running self-locking barbed sutures (Filbloc® 3/0, Assut Europe, Italy or alternatively V-LocTM 3/0, Medtronic, USA) that run in the same direction from 3 to 9 o’clock. Of note is the fact that, after having applied the first stitch on the posterior wall we customarily pass the needle back below the first stitch to evert the posterior esophageal and gastric layer and improve their visualization. Once the posterior aspect of the anastomosis is complete, a NGT is placed under direct vision inside the stomach distally to the anastomosis, thus accomplishing the closure of anterior surface. Finally, a few tension release stitches are put in between the mediastinal pleura and seromuscular layer of the gastric tube. The anastomosis is checked for intraoperative leaks with methylene blue and a 28-Fr chest drain is inserted via the R1 robotic trocar, posteriorly to anastomosis, with the apex in the upper chest (Video).\nStricture 8/30 = 27%\n\n\n\nTurkey (Batirel, 2022) - 30% stricture rate\n\n\n\n(chao?)\n\n\n\nLahey Clinic (stock?)\nNCDB: RMIE vs tMIE: 23% robotic.

Arm 1 (da Vinci 8 mm, R1) is placed on right MCL at least 8 cm away from R2.

    "text": "Italy (Huscher et al., 2023) 40 patients over 4 years\nAll patients underwent a fast-track surgical protocol. The Da Vinci ® Si robotic system was positioned perpendicular to the patient’s right side and docked to the trocars. For the abdominal part of the procedure, the patient was positioned in a supine position. The four robotic trocars were placed in a horizontal line at or above the umbilicus (Fig. 1). In the abdomen, CO2 insufflation with 14 mmHg of pressure was used. Targeting to the stomach was performed. The surgical assistant was located on the left side of the table. A tip-up fenestrated grasper in trocar 1 was used to elevate the left lobe of the liver and for certain retraction movements during the abdominal part. The fenestrated bipolar forceps were used in the 12-mm trocar (no. 2) with a reduction cartridge, and later the 12-mm trocar was used for the robotic Endo Wrist ® stapler 45 mm to form the gastric conduit, beginning from the lesser curvature near the crow foot and continued towards the fundus, parallel to the greater curvature. After the abdominal dissection and creation of the conduit for reconstruction, Indocyanine Green (ICG) test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of the gastric conduit. For the thoracic part of the procedure (Fig. 2), the patient was positioned in a prone position (the operation table was tilted 19° towards the prone) and three robotic trocars and one laparoscopic trocar were inserted on the right chest. A single-lumen tube was used for intubation and the right lung was not deflated and disconnected from ventilation. In the chest, CO2 insufflation with 8 mmHg of pressure was enough to obtain an optimal working volume. The pulmonary ligament was divided. Hereafter, the parietal pleura was dissected at the anterior side of the esophagus from the diaphragm, up to the azygos vein. The azygos vein was ligated with Hem-o-lok and divided. At the posterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is dissected cranially to caudally along the azygos vein, including the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct was clipped with a 10-mm endoclip. To facilitate esophagus mobilization, a Penrose drain was placed around the esophagus to manipulate the esophagus for further mobilization. The thoracic esophagus was mobilized and transected at the level of the azygos vein. The esophagus was resected en bloc with the surrounding mediastinal lymph nodes. The resected specimen will contain right-side paratracheal (station 2R), tracheobronchial (station 4), aortopulmonary window (station 5), carinal (station 7), and periesophageal (station 8) lymph nodes. The reconstruction time started with the anchoring of the gastric conduit to the esophageal stump with two 3–0 silk stay sutures. The conduit was opened on the anterior wall by the adoption of a monopolar hook. An end-to-side roboticsewn anastomosis was created by the adoption of two 3–0 running barbed sutures (V-loc – Medtronic, USA – Fig. 3).11, 12 After completion of the anterior wall, a nasogastric tube was passed through the half-completed anastomosis. Once the anastomosis was completed, 3–0 silk interrupted sutures were placed circumferentially to reinforce it (Fig. 4; Video). Before and after anastomosis fashioning, an ICG test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of conduit. In addition, the conduit cul-de-sac was suspended at the posterior thoracic wall by two stitches. The specimen was extracted through a small thoracotomy and a right-sided chest tube was placed. No postoperative swallow tests were performed. In the absence of clinical signs of anastomotic dehiscence (for example, luminal contents through the drain or wound site/local inflammation; fever (&gt; 38 °C) or leukocytosis (&gt; 10,000/L); leak may also be detected on imaging studies), patients started with sips of water at the day 3 and the oral intake was gradually increased to solid food. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines were used in the postoperative protocol.\nLeak rate 4/40 = 10%\nStricture 10/40 = 25%\nItaly 30 patients (Marano et al., 2023)\nSingle‐lung ventilation is introduced, and the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, tilted 45° compared to the prone position. For both robotic systems, the cart is docked from the right side of the patient. In addition, three robotic ports are put in place as well as two thoracoscopic ports for the assistant. dV®SiTM port layout for this stage has previously been described [24]. It’s worthy of mention that an additional 5 mm port for the assistant is placed between the intercostal spaces (ICS) 6 and 10, along the posterior axillary line. Figure 2 shows the dV®XiTM trocar position (three-arms technique) in a slight U shape: robotic arm#1(R1) for the grasper or the bipolar forceps at the ICS 9, robotic arm#2 (R2) for the 30° down scope at the ICS 6, posterior to the posterior axillary line and robotic arm#3 (R3) for the monopolar cautery hook, the needle driver or the clip applier at the ICS 4, anterior to the scapular rim. Furthermore assistant port #1(A1, 12-mm) is located in the ILC 8, and assistant port #2 (A2, 5 mm) between R2 and R3 at the posterior axillary line. The targeting area is identified at the level of the Azygos arch. A 7–8 mmHg pneumothorax is then induced. Starting at the anterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is cut from the level of the azygos arch down to the diaphragm where the pulmonary ligament is divided. The azygos arch is then sectioned with robotic Weck Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) and a right paratracheal lymphadenectomy is performed. Next, the dissection of the parietal pleura is deepened towards the esophageal hiatus until the aorta becomes exposed. Subsequently, the right vagus nerve is sectioned just below the carina, preserving its bronchial branches. The dissection of the esophagus is extended below the tracheal bifurcation and a Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus to facilitate traction.\nThe dissection of the esophagus is then continued along the pericardium down to the diaphragm and the thoracic duct is clipped with robotic clips. The resection of the esophagus en-bloc with periesophageal, bronchial and subcarinal nodes (stations # 107–111) and the thoracic duct is fully completed from the diaphragm up to the azygos arch. The proximal esophagus is divided using a robotic cautery hook above the level of the azygos vein. At this point, the instruments in R1 and R3 are reversed to be able to carefully pull the esophago-gastric bloc and the gastric conduit up through the hiatus until the marker suture becomes visible. The specimen and conduit thus are disconnected, and the specimen is placed in a plastic bag which will be removed through the enlarged incision of the assistant port. Thereafter, four supportive 4-0 polyglactin 910 (Ethicon Inc. USA) stitches are put in between the mucosae and the muscularis externa layer of the esophagus at the four cardinal points to evert the esophageal mucosae. Next, the proximal esophagus is dilatated using a Foley catheter inflated with 10 cc of sterile water for approximately 2–3 min. After having assessed both gastric conduit and esophageal perfusion with ICG fluorescence, a gastrotomy is performed at the most proximal portion of the conduit, maintaining at least 2 cm of distance from the stapler line. A single-layer robot-sewn esophagogastric anastomosis is performed above the level of the azygos arch with two separate running self-locking barbed sutures (Filbloc® 3/0, Assut Europe, Italy or alternatively V-LocTM 3/0, Medtronic, USA) that run in the same direction from 3 to 9 o’clock. Of note is the fact that, after having applied the first stitch on the posterior wall we customarily pass the needle back below the first stitch to evert the posterior esophageal and gastric layer and improve their visualization. Once the posterior aspect of the anastomosis is complete, a NGT is placed under direct vision inside the stomach distally to the anastomosis, thus accomplishing the closure of anterior surface. Finally, a few tension release stitches are put in between the mediastinal pleura and seromuscular layer of the gastric tube. The anastomosis is checked for intraoperative leaks with methylene blue and a 28-Fr chest drain is inserted via the R1 robotic trocar, posteriorly to anastomosis, with the apex in the upper chest (Video).\nStricture 8/30 = 27%"

    "text": "Circular Stapled Anastomosis\nGerman Group (Egberts et al., 2017)\nAn 8-mm da Vinci port (which serves as arm 2 (R2)) is placed in the midline slightly above or at the umbilicus. Arm 3 (da Vinci 8 mm, R3) is positioned on the left mid-clavicular line (MCL) at least 8 cm away from R2 on a straight line, followed by the fourth arm (da Vinci 8 mm, R4) as far left lateral from R3 as possible. Arm 1 (da Vinci 8 mm, R1) is placed on right MCL at least 8 cm away from R2. Depending on the use of the EndoWrist® stapler, either a da Vinci 13-mm port or a standard da Vinci 8-mm port is used (if laparoscopic stapling is through a 12-mm assistant port). A 12-mm assistant port is triangulated midway inferior between R3 and R4. If a laparoscopic stapler is used, R1 (da Vinci 8 mm) is placed as lateral as possible on the right, 2–3 cm superior to the arm 2 port and at least 8 cm away from a 12-mm assistant port (A) used for the laparoscopic stapling. The assistant port (A) is then moved to the location of R1 (Fig. 3a). For liver retraction (LR), a 5-mm port is placed either subcostally on the right MCL (retraction with a laparoscopic grasper) or subxiphiodal for a Nathanson retractor\nThoracic Phase Single lung ventilation is induced and moderate CO2 insufflation of ~ 8 mmHg is applied, creating the surgical workspace in the thorax. The ports are placed as follows: R4 (da Vinci 8 mm port) in the 4th intercostal space (ICS), 1 cm medial to the scapula; R3 (da Vinci 8 mm port) in the 6th ICS, slightly more medial than port 4; R2 (da Vinci 8 mm port) in the 8th ICS at the same level as port 4; R1 (da Vinci 13 mm port) on the scapular line or slightly posterior in the 10th ICS. A 6–10cm spacing is maintained between ports. This port is used for the EndoWrist® Stapler (if a laparoscopic stapler is used, a da Vinci 8-mm port is adequate). There are two recommended options for the assistant port (12 mm (A)) location, depending on surgeon’s preference for the introduction of the circular stapler to construct the oesophagogastrostomy. (A)1 is in the 9th ICS, triangulated between R1 and R2; this would be the site for specimen removal and entrance of circular stapler. Alternatively, (A)2 is triangulated between R3 and R4 in the 5th ICS. The assistant port might be enlarged to a minithoracotomy (~ 3–5 cm) with a size Bsmall^ or Bx-small^ Alexis Wound Retractor (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) placed here. This would be the site for specimen removal and entrance of the circular stapler (Fig. 3b).\nLiver Retraction Utilising a method for static retraction allows all da Vinci instrument arms to be free for dynamic use and localised static retraction where necessary. There are two different options to retract the liver with a Bstatic system^: the placement of a long bariatric grasper through a 5-mm port in the right flank to lift up the right hepatic lobe (using locking bariatric grasper to Block^ grips on the right crus for static retraction of liver) or a Nathanson Liver Retractor (Cook Medical, Limerick, Ireland). Gastric and Distal Oesophagus Mobilisation The dissection begins by opening the gastro-hepatic ligament close to the liver and up to the right crus of the diaphragm, after evaluation of an aberrant left gastric artery. The common hepatic artery is identified, followed by lymph node dissection of its upper margin up to the celiac axis. The right gastric artery is preserved. The DII lymphadenectomy is then completed to the area of the coelic trunk and splenic and left gastric artery. The left gastric artery and the atrial coronary vein are ligated using a Large or Medium-Large Clip in R3. The gastric mobilisation follows a medial to lateral approach. The gastric fundus is lifted up with the forceps in the secondary arm on the right (R4) to expose the oesophageal hiatus, right and left crura, and the lesser sac. Care should be taken if a posterior gastric artery is encountered. The retro-gastric adhesions, as well as the short gastric arteries, can be dissected and ligated safely with the EndoWrist Vessel Sealer or Harmonic ACE. The hiatus is dissected and, if necessary, widened by severing the right crus of the diaphragm. By doing so, the oesophagus can be released circumferentially and mobilised high into the mediastinal cavity, which leads to a less challenging dissection of the greater gastric curvature and conservation of the right gastroepiploic arcade by fully dissecting the gastrocolic ligament. The fundus of the stomach is elevated with R4, while the bedside assistant elevates the stomach by lifting the antrum. The large curvature of the stomach is mobilised by dissecting the gastrocolic ligament from caudal to cranial, preserving the right gastroepiploic vascular arcade. Gastric Tube Construction The construction of the gastric tube starts at the pyloric antrum. A stomach tube on the site of the greater curvature (5 cm diameter) is formed. To approximate the diameter of the gastric tube, either the Cadiere Forceps (grasping tip length 20 mm) or the Tip-Up Fenestrated Grasper (grasping tip length 32 mm) can be held up against the gastric conduit. The stomach is carefully elongated with the EndoWrist instruments. The stomach tube is only partially created in the abdominal cavity. For this, the stomach is stapled using only 3–5 45- or 60-mm stapler magazines to create the initial part of the tube, with a remnant stomach left to subsequently introduce the circular stapler (Fig. 4a). Surgical Steps, Thoracic Phase Dissection of the Oesophagus Depending on the location of the tumour, the dissection usually removes all tissues superiorly along the pericardium from the level of the hiatus and inferior vena cava to the carina, lower trachea and right main bronchus, posteriorly along the length of the thoracic aorta, and laterally along the pleural surfaces. Therefore, the dissection plane is according to the described meso-oesophagus—defined by the adventitia of the aorta, mediastinal pleura with view of the ventilated left lung, and the pericardium.9 If the dissection level cannot be kept clear due to the assumed tumour extension or preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, an extension of the resection level is possible with removal of the mediastinal pleura and/or pericardium. The oesophagus is transected slightly above the level of the usually ligated azygos vein with a linear stapler and is then cranially separated from it with scissors so that a frozen section can be obtained from the oral resection. Stomach Pull-up This manoeuvre should be done with extreme caution due to the risk of damaging the fragile gastric tube. The patient-side assistant should support the pull-up with laparoscopic graspers. Special attention is given to not twisting it by keeping the gastroepiploic arcade dorsally. The stomach is pulled into the thorax through the extended hiatus until the area of the unfinished gastric tube at the remnant stomach is comfortably located in the middle of the right thoracic cavity. This ensures that the maximum available length of the stomach tube is utilized Circular Stapled Anastomosis The circular stapler anvil (a 28/29-mm sized circular stapler device with a long handle is recommended) is inserted transthoracically through the Alexis wound retractor into the oesophageal stump and secured with a purse-string suture constructed, for example, using a StratafixTM Spiral® PDS 3-0, SH needle, 15 cm length or Prolene 2/0 (Fig. 5a). The intact minor gastric curvature of the transected specimen is brought out of the chest through the mini-thoracotomy. The circular stapler handle is then introduced into the stomach conduit via an incision in the minor curvature (Fig. 4b), and the best position for the anastomosis near the greater curvature of the conduit is chosen. The camera might be positioned in Trocar 1 for this manoeuvre to have a superior overview. The perfusion of the gastric conduit can also be checked again for confirmation with indocyanine green (Fig. 5b, c). The gastric conduit is then straightened by the assistant and stapled to the oesophageal stump. Next, a bougie is inserted past the anastomosis into the gastric conduit, to prevent narrowing of the proximal conduit during the subsequent specimen transection. The remaining gastric part with the oesophageal specimen attached is transected with a linear stapler (Figs. 4c and 5d) and removed through the mini-thoracotomy. In the case of a widely opened hiatus, a fixation suture can be applied to the hiatus to avoid possible herniation. Due to the mobility of the instruments, this is easily possible with the robot.\nGrimminger PP, Hadzijusufovic E, Lang H: Robotic-Assisted Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy (RAMIE) with a Standardized Intrathoracic Circular End-to-side Stapled Anastomosis and a Team of Two (Surgeon and Assistant Only).

An additional purse string suture is placed to reinforce this staple purse string suture. The EEA stapler is introduced through the access incision and is placed through a gastrostomy in the proximal conduit. The stapler spike is advanced out through the lateral wall of the conduit just above the level of the vascular arcade insertion. The stapler and anvil are docked ensuring flush apposition of the tissues and appropriate orientation. The stapler is fired and the anastomosis completed.\n(Okusanya et al., 2017b)\n(Sarkaria and Rizk, 2014) Technique paper with videos\nTampa (Pointer et al., 2022) Leak rate 16%. 30-day mortality 3%\nTechnique: Amaral M, Pimiento J, Fontaine JP.

After having assessed both gastric conduit and esophageal perfusion with ICG fluorescence, a gastrotomy is performed at the most proximal portion of the conduit, maintaining at least 2 cm of distance from the stapler line. A single-layer robot-sewn esophagogastric anastomosis is performed above the level of the azygos arch with two separate running self-locking barbed sutures (Filbloc® 3/0, Assut Europe, Italy or alternatively V-LocTM 3/0, Medtronic, USA) that run in the same direction from 3 to 9 o’clock. Of note is the fact that, after having applied the first stitch on the posterior wall we customarily pass the needle back below the first stitch to evert the posterior esophageal and gastric layer and improve their visualization. Once the posterior aspect of the anastomosis is complete, a NGT is placed under direct vision inside the stomach distally to the anastomosis, thus accomplishing the closure of anterior surface. Finally, a few tension release stitches are put in between the mediastinal pleura and seromuscular layer of the gastric tube. The anastomosis is checked for intraoperative leaks with methylene blue and a 28-Fr chest drain is inserted via the R1 robotic trocar, posteriorly to anastomosis, with the apex in the upper chest (Video).\nStricture 8/30 = 27%"

    "text": "Myosteasosis\n\nMethods\nMost studies have measured myosteatosis (‘muscle quality’) as the Hounsfield units of the skeletal muscle area at L3 defined with thresholds of -29HU to +150HU. The challenge with this approach is the relatively small dispersion of Hounsfield Units.\nAn alternative is to subdivide skeletal muscle area into high density and low density areas. One method is to distinguish normal attenuation muscle area (NAMA) from low attenuation muscle area (LAMA). This was initially described by investigators from Japan (Kim et al., 2021). The same grouop measured IMAT within the muscle envelope using fat thresholds. See also\nAn alternative (experimental) approach would be assume that a density histogram of the muscle area is a gaussian mixture of two peaks - one for muscle and one for adipose tissue, and to use a mathematical tool such as the mixtools R package to resolve the density histogram into two peaks.\nPapers using gaussian mixture for segmentation:\nAn automated and robust framework for quantification of muscle and fat in the thigh (Tan et al., 2014)\nJ. de Carvalho Felinto et al., “Automatic segmentation and quantification of thigh tissues in CT images,” in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 2018, vol. 10960 LNCS, pp. 261–276, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-95162-1_18.\nGMM for liver segmentation(dunj5654424?)\nJohnson SB Mixture model see ForestFit R package\n\nMyosteatosis\nMeta-analysis of 40 studies: overall prevalence of 48% among cancer patients, with HR of 1.75 for mortality.

    "text": "Disparities in esophageal cancer\nSEER Trends in esophageal cancer: (Corona et al. 2021) The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC = 1.60, p = 0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC = - 4.53, p &lt; 0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity.\nSEER no survival difference based upon race (Tramontano et al. 2018) T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p &lt; 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors.\nNCDB comparison of hospitals (Sridhar et al. 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Could preferential use of High Burden Hospitals by racial minorities account for their worse outcomes?\nMichigan Cancer Registry marital status at the time of diagnosis (Paniagua Cruz et al. 2020) 88.4% of our patients were White and 11.6% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9% v 31.8%, respectively; P &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment.Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes. Marital status at dx is a field in the CR Star data!!\nNCDB (Schlottmann et al. 2020) NCDB Stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. but was histology included in their model? Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. Is the negative effect on survival due to race or insurance status/geography?\n(Savitch et al. 2021) NCDB stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015 matched cohorts White:Black. 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. Did this study account for histology? What about SES?\nSmae study, different journal: (Revels et al. 2013) NCDB 2004-2015 Stage I-III esophageal cancer. Matched patient cohorts were created to reduce confounding. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receipt of surgery. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization.Total of 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients evenly distributed across race. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. Looks identical to (Savitch et al. 2021)\n(Swords et al. 2020) NCDB 2003-2011 Stage I-III esophageal cancer. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, *SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not.**\n(Savitch et al. 2021) NCDB 2004-2015 Stage I-III esophgeal cancer. Matched patient cohorts were created to reduce confounding. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization. Total of 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients evenly distributed across race. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival. **Another way of studying access to surgical care - this time at the facility level. Further su*pport for the theme that access to surgery is barrier to optimal esophageal cancer care.**\n(Erhunmwunsee et al. 2017) NCDB stage I-III 2003-2011. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. Did study include histology in their model?\n(Okereke et al. 2021) NCDB 2004-2017: 127,098 patients. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery).\n(Sridhar et al. 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). Conclusions: There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH.\nCalifornia Cancer Registry (Tran et al. 2017) Esophageal cancer cases 2004-2010. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Sounds like receipt of surgery remains disparate based upon race and accounts for some differences in outcome"

    "text": "Disparities in access to surgical care\nNorth Carolina (Wong et al. 2021) compared per capita rate of surgery in 5 high-resource counties with 5 low-resource counties using is data from the Health Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database from 2016. Using the surgical rate observed in the 5 highest-ranked counties (HRCs), the expected surgical rate in the 5 lowest-ranked counties (LRCs) in North Carolina were calculated. Patients 18 years and older who underwent an inpatient general surgery procedure and patients who underwent emergency inpatient cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy, or bariatric surgery in 2016 were included. The primary outcome was the proportional surgical ratio (PSR), which was the disparity in surgical access defined as the observed number of surgical procedures in the 5 LRCs relative to the expected number of procedures using the 5 HRCs as the standardized reference population. In 2016, approximately 1.9 million adults lived in the 5 HRCs, while approximately 246 854 lived in the 5 LRCs. A total of 28 924 inpatient general surgical procedures were performed, with 4521 being performed in those living in the 5 LRCs and 24 403 in those living in the 5 HRCs. The rate of general surgery in the 5 HRCs was 13.09 procedures per 1000 population. Using the 5 HRCs as the reference, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.35-1.44). For emergent/urgent cholecystectomy, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 2.26 (95% CI, 2.02-2.51), and the PSR for emergent/urgent herniorrhaphy was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.33-2.45). Age-adjusted rate of obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] greater than 30), on average, was 36.6% (SD, 3.4) in the 5 LRCs vs 25.4% (SD, 4.6) in the 5 HRCs (P = .002). The rate of bariatric surgery in the 5 HRCs was 33.07 per 10 000 population with obesity. For the 5 LRCs, the PSR was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.51-0.69). Could we use this same database for esophagectomy? Need to figure out whether patients that have surgery in an read different from where they live are scored as their county of residence or county where surgery was done\n(degajer276?)\nBody composition and Racial/Ethnic differences\nAge - Sex - Race body composition standard Curves(Magudia et al. 2021)\n\nBackground Although CT-based body composition (BC) metrics may inform disease risk and outcomes, obtaining these metrics has been too resource intensive for large-scale use. Thus, population-wide distributions of BC remain uncertain. Purpose To demonstrate the validity of fully automated, deep learning BC analysis from abdominal CT examinations, to define demographically adjusted BC reference curves, and to illustrate the advantage of use of these curves compared with standard methods, along with their biologic significance in predicting survival. Materials and Methods After external validation and equivalency testing with manual segmentation, a fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was applied to a cross-sectional population cohort that included any outpatient without a cardiovascular disease or cancer who underwent abdominal CT examination at one of three hospitals in 2012. Demographically adjusted population reference curves were generated for each BC area. The z scores derived from these curves were compared with sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia by using χ2 tests and used to predict 2-year survival in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included weight and body mass index (BMI). Results External validation showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99) and equivalency (P &lt; .001) of the fully automated deep learning BC analysis method with manual segmentation. With use of the fully automated BC data from 12 128 outpatients (mean age, 52 years; 6936 [57%] women), age-, race-, and sex-normalized BC reference curves were generated. All BC areas varied significantly with these variables (P &lt; .001 except for subcutaneous fat area vs age [P = .003]). Sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia demonstrated that age and race bias were not present if z scores derived from the reference curves were used (P &lt; .001). Skeletal muscle area z scores were significantly predictive of 2-year survival (P = .04) in combined models that included BMI. Conclusion Fully automated body composition (BC) metrics vary significantly by age, race, and sex. The z scores derived from reference curves for BC parameters better capture the demographic distribution of BC compared with standard methods and can help predict survival. Investigators at the University of Illinois {Jang et al. (2020)} examined the change in skeletal muscle index during cancer treatment among 212 patients. Among 132 non-Hispanic Black patients, muscle loss during therapy was greater than non-Hispanic White and Other (Asian + Hispanic) (Odds Ratio 3.29 p=0.004). The loss was highest in Black rectal cancer patients (11 units of SMI loss cm2/m2) vs White rectal Cancer (8 cm2/m2). Loss among colon cancer patients was higher in Black patients ( 5.5 cm2/m2) than in White patients (2.5 cm2/m2). Prior to treatment, Blacks had higher SMI than White (similar to findings of Xaio 2019)\n\nData from Kaiser (xaio615?) examined 3263 patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer. Black patients had higher lower rates of sarcopenia according to the definition of Prado et al. Patients with higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio had higher risk of muscle abnormality. CT scan at L3 was analyed to determine SMI,IMAT,VAT,SAT and TAT (=VAT+SAT+IMAT) using SliceOMatic. Threshold values determined for optimal stratification (cf (martin153?)

(Feliciano et al. 2017)\nPMID 24122750\nPMID 24866483\nLow muscle mass has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis cancer patients.(Martin et al. 2013) This may be due to overal frailty or low muscle mass may lead to increased toxicity from chemotherapy due to pharmacokinetic mechanism. 5-FU is hydrophilic and it volume of distribution includes the muscle compartment, while oxaliplatin is hydrophobic, with distribution in the fat compartment(Bozzetti 2017).\nIn addition, loss of muscle mass during chemotherapy for advanced cancers is a poor prognosticator.\nBlauhoff (Blauwhoff-Buskermolen et al. 2016) studis 67 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Muscle area on CT decreased by 6.1% over 3 months. Patients in the lowest tertile (loss of 9%) had worse survial. Overall survival 17.5 months for first-line chemotherapy and 8.5months for second-line. Baseline muscle density was predictive of survival on multivariable analysis, but low SMI at baseline was not associatesd with survival. (This may be because sarcopenic obesity is the major risk factor, and there were few obese patients in the study cohort) &gt;Muscle loss of 9% or more remained independently associated with survival when adjusted for sex, age, baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, comorbidity, mono-organ or multiorgan metastases, treatment line, and tumor progression at first evaluation by computed tomography scan (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.21 to 9.05; P , .001). We found a mean coefficient of variation between observers of 0.6% for skeletal muscle area in a random sample of 20 patients, which is regarded to be low.(MacDonald, Greig, and Baracos 2011). Changes between the first and second scans were calculated as a rate of change per 3 months, meaning change per first evaluation, to compare with available literature.[awad74][prado1583]Relative muscle change per 3 months was categorized into tertiles of muscle change: tertile one, highest muscle loss up to 9%; tertile two, muscle loss of 9% to 1.5%; and tertile three, muscle loss of 1.5% until highest gain in muscle. However, the survival curve of tertile two was not significantly different from the survival curve of tertile three (log-rank P = .961); therefore tertiles two and three were pooled (cutoff, 9% muscle loss).\nAwad (Awad et al. 2012)studies changes in body composition during neodjuvant chemotherapy for esophagogastric cancer.\nKurk (Kurk et al. 2020) found that skeletal muscle loss during chemotherapy was associated with decreased progression-free and overall- survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nDetailed changes in skeletal muscle mass and body weight during CAIRO3 treatments were previously reported.KurkS, p909, 2018) We additionally analyzed changes in SMI and BMI during these treatments by linear mixed effects models.(Bayar MA,p311,2017) The baseline value of the outcome (SMI/BMI) was included in the outcome vector. Potential confounders were age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, best response to initial six cycles CAPOX‐B, resection of the primary tumor, and the number of metastatic sites. The final model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and included: treatment arm, time, age, sex, resection primary tumor, and the interaction of treatment arm by time as fixed effects. Modeling time as a random effect did not increase the model fit as indicated by the AIC. To investigate differences in SMI and BMI changes over time between the CAIRO3 treatment arms, we checked the significance of the two‐way interaction including treatment arm by time.\n\n\nDuring p2 (maintenance CAP‐B/observation), again absolute SMI and BMI at the start (t1) of treatment were not associated with early progression and death. In contrast, SMI loss and BMI loss during treatment were associated with early progression and death.\n\nFogelman (Fogelman et al. 2014) treated patients undergoing chemotherapy with a novel agent designed to reduce muscle less. CT scans at 2 months were compared with baseline scans prior to chemotherapy.\n\nChanges in skeletal muscle were determined using routinely acquired CT scans for patients on the study. We calculated skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). A single slice at the mid-point of L3 was used, preferably a 2.5-mm slice if available, and a 5-mm slice if a 2.5-mm slice was not available. The L3 is a landmark that has been extensively used and validated in studies assessing body composition in cancer patients [Shen et al. (2004)](C. M. M. Prado, Birdsell, and Baracos 2009) . Skeletal muscle surface areas were determined using Slice-o-Matic softwareTM, version 4.3 (Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada) using pre-established thresholds of Hounsfield units (HU) of −29 to +150 (Mitsiopoulos et al. 1998). We additionally evaluated adipose tissue cross-sectional area (subcutaneous, visceral, and intramuscular) in the L3 region as described previously (Mourtzakis et al. 2008). Changes in muscle and adipose tissue surface areas over time were determined for each patient from the baseline study to the first CT post treatment, done after 2 months. We looked at muscle loss as a continuous variable and defined “meaningful loss” as greater than a 6 cm2 difference from the baseline to the second scan. We chose this cut point as it is equivalent to 1 kg of skeletal muscle and is associated with physical function (i.e., muscle strength). Additionally, this cut point has been used to investigate significant changes in muscle mass throughout cancer disease trajectory [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al. 1988)(C. M. Prado et al. 2013).\n\nPrado (C. M. Prado et al. 2013) looked at changes in 1279 CT scans in 368 patients with advanced cancer. The last available interval with CT scans was chosen for comparison. Categorized into stable, gaining, losing for muscle and for adipose tissue. Adipose tissue was ?? sum of visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous tissue. (Did not use SMI). Muscel loss and adipose loss seemed correlated, with larger magnitude of adipose tissue loss at short interval to death. (Authors conclusion that muscle and adipose tissue loss in the past 3 months of life is likely not possible) &gt;Advanced-cancer patients (n = 368; median survival: 196 d) had a total of 1279 CT images over the course of their disease. With consideration of all time points, muscle loss occurred in 39% of intervals between any 2 scans. However, the overall frequency of muscle gain was 15.4%, and muscle was stable in 45.6% of intervals between any 2 scans, which made the maintenance or gain of muscle the predominant behavior. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that being within 90 d (compared with &gt;90 d) from death was the principal risk factor for muscle loss (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.94; P = 0.002), and muscle gain was correspondingly less likely (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.69; P = 0.002) at this time. Sex, age, BMI, and tumor group were not significant predictors of muscle loss or gain. A much higher proportion of men (61%) than women (31%) met the criteria for sarcopenia. Changes in muscle and adipose tissue over time were calculated as the absolute loss or gain of tissue area during each scan interval. The precision error of measurements was ~1.5% (Mourtzakis et al. 2008) with a minimum detectable change of ~3 cm2. We attributed the change during each interval into the following categories: 1) muscle loss ≥6.0 cm2, 2) stable muscle ±5.9 cm2, or 3) muscle gain ≥6.0cm2. These cutoffs are equivalent to a loss or gain of ≥1 kg of skeletal muscle on a whole-body basis and are associated with alterations in muscle strength [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al. 1988). For adipose tissue, categories were based on the equivalence of 14.7 cm2 total fat at L3 and 1 kg tissue on a whole-body basis (Shen et al. 2004); therefore, changes during each interval were categorized as 1) adipose tissue loss ≥14.7 cm2, 2) stable adipose tissue ±14.6 cm2, or 3) adipose tissue gain ≥14.7 cm2. CT scans were taken for the diagnosis, confirmation of stage, and follow-up of disease progression and treatment. With the understanding that cachexia evolves markedly in the end of life and to take advantage of repeated measures, we focused on patients with ≥2 CT images (2–6 images) on record during the year preceding their deaths (n = 368). A selection bias was not apparent in this sample; we showed that the sex distribution, age at death, survival time, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, and body-composition features (ie, muscle and adipose tissues) in patients who had only a single scan were not different from those of the overall cohort at an equal time to death (P &gt; 0.1). Patients included in the analysis (n = 368) were of advanced stage, and the median time to death of all groups was &lt;1 y.\nSimilar study by Tan looking at longitudinal body composition in pancreatic cancer (Tan et al. 2009). 111 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer: 44 identified with more than one scan. Patients who underwent repeated CT scans were more likely to receive active therapy (71%) and had longer survival than those who had a solitary CT scan (28% receiving active chemotherapy). OVeral median survival 130 days. Age and sarcopenic obesity predicted survival. Sarcopenic obesity had survival of 55 days vs 148 days for those without sarcopenia obesity. Muscle loss was normalized to percent during 100 days. Median interval between scans was ??135 days. Patients grouped in tertiles for muscle gain/loss. Top tertile gained 7% muscle cross-sectional area/100 days, while bottom tertile lost 12% over 100 days. All tertiles lost adipose tissue. No difference in survival between the tertiles. &gt; muscle loss was the prevalent behavior, but 14% of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (considered the disease most highly associated with cachexia) exhibited a muscle gain of 7.9 ± 14.4%/100 d).\nLieffers and advanced colorectal cancer: Found liver and spleen increased in size in terminal patients (causing increase in basal metabolic rate). Found more rapid muscle loss with progressive disease (Lieffers et al. 2009). Different thresholds for VAT (-150 to -50) and SAT(-190 to -30). Also estimated muscel surface area using measurements 5cm above L4(Shen et al. 2004). Most rapid change in body composition between 4 months and 1 month prior to death. &gt;14% of patients gained skeletal muscle during the year preceding death from colorectal cancer (+4.7 ± 5.4%/100 d).\nLongitudinal study of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (all with &lt;1yr survival). (Baracos et al. 2010) &gt;At referral (median time to death: 265 d), mean body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) was 24.9, with 47.4% of patients being overweight or obese. Only 7.5% overall were underweight as conventionally understood (BMI &lt; 18.5). Analysis of computed tomography images showed extremely high heterogeneity of muscle mass within all strata of BMI. The overall prevalence of severe muscle depletion (sarcopenia) was 46.8% and was present in patients in all BMI categories.\nCaan (Caan et al. 2017) examined body composition and survival from colorecal cncer at Kaiser.\nBody composition and gastric cancer\nPMID 34774016\n\n\n\n\nAwad, Sherif, Benjamin H.

Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity.\nSEER no survival difference based upon race (Tramontano et al. 2018) T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p &lt; 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors.\nNCDB comparison of hospitals (Sridhar et al. 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014).

Could preferential use of High Burden Hospitals by racial minorities account for their worse outcomes?\nMichigan Cancer Registry marital status at the time of diagnosis (Paniagua Cruz et al. 2020) 88.4% of our patients were White and 11.6% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9% v 31.8%, respectively; P &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment.Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes.

Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer.

Using the surgical rate observed in the 5 highest-ranked counties (HRCs), the expected surgical rate in the 5 lowest-ranked counties (LRCs) in North Carolina were calculated. Patients 18 years and older who underwent an inpatient general surgery procedure and patients who underwent emergency inpatient cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy, or bariatric surgery in 2016 were included. The primary outcome was the proportional surgical ratio (PSR), which was the disparity in surgical access defined as the observed number of surgical procedures in the 5 LRCs relative to the expected number of procedures using the 5 HRCs as the standardized reference population. In 2016, approximately 1.9 million adults lived in the 5 HRCs, while approximately 246 854 lived in the 5 LRCs. A total of 28 924 inpatient general surgical procedures were performed, with 4521 being performed in those living in the 5 LRCs and 24 403 in those living in the 5 HRCs. The rate of general surgery in the 5 HRCs was 13.09 procedures per 1000 population. Using the 5 HRCs as the reference, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.35-1.44). For emergent/urgent cholecystectomy, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 2.26 (95% CI, 2.02-2.51), and the PSR for emergent/urgent herniorrhaphy was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.33-2.45). Age-adjusted rate of obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] greater than 30), on average, was 36.6% (SD, 3.4) in the 5 LRCs vs 25.4% (SD, 4.6) in the 5 HRCs (P = .002). The rate of bariatric surgery in the 5 HRCs was 33.07 per 10 000 population with obesity. For the 5 LRCs, the PSR was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.51-0.69). Could we use this same database for esophagectomy?

Thus, population-wide distributions of BC remain uncertain. Purpose To demonstrate the validity of fully automated, deep learning BC analysis from abdominal CT examinations, to define demographically adjusted BC reference curves, and to illustrate the advantage of use of these curves compared with standard methods, along with their biologic significance in predicting survival. Materials and Methods After external validation and equivalency testing with manual segmentation, a fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was applied to a cross-sectional population cohort that included any outpatient without a cardiovascular disease or cancer who underwent abdominal CT examination at one of three hospitals in 2012. Demographically adjusted population reference curves were generated for each BC area. The z scores derived from these curves were compared with sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia by using χ2 tests and used to predict 2-year survival in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included weight and body mass index (BMI). Results External validation showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99) and equivalency (P &lt; .001) of the fully automated deep learning BC analysis method with manual segmentation. With use of the fully automated BC data from 12 128 outpatients (mean age, 52 years; 6936 [57%] women), age-, race-, and sex-normalized BC reference curves were generated. All BC areas varied significantly with these variables (P &lt; .001 except for subcutaneous fat area vs age [P = .003]). Sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia demonstrated that age and race bias were not present if z scores derived from the reference curves were used (P &lt; .001). Skeletal muscle area z scores were significantly predictive of 2-year survival (P = .04) in combined models that included BMI. Conclusion Fully automated body composition (BC) metrics vary significantly by age, race, and sex. The z scores derived from reference curves for BC parameters better capture the demographic distribution of BC compared with standard methods and can help predict survival. Investigators at the University of Illinois {Jang et al. (2020)} examined the change in skeletal muscle index during cancer treatment among 212 patients. Among 132 non-Hispanic Black patients, muscle loss during therapy was greater than non-Hispanic White and Other (Asian + Hispanic) (Odds Ratio 3.29 p=0.004). The loss was highest in Black rectal cancer patients (11 units of SMI loss cm2/m2) vs White rectal Cancer (8 cm2/m2). Loss among colon cancer patients was higher in Black patients ( 5.5 cm2/m2) than in White patients (2.5 cm2/m2). Prior to treatment, Blacks had higher SMI than White (similar to findings of Xaio 2019)\n\nData from Kaiser (xaio615?) examined 3263 patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer. Black patients had higher lower rates of sarcopenia according to the definition of Prado et al. Patients with higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio had higher risk of muscle abnormality. CT scan at L3 was analyed to determine SMI,IMAT,VAT,SAT and TAT (=VAT+SAT+IMAT) using SliceOMatic. Threshold values determined for optimal stratification (cf (martin153?)

In multivariate analysis including age, sex, BMI, sarcopenia, SAT, and VAT, the only factor associated with Grade 3-4 toxicities was sarcopenia (odds ratio = 13.55; 95% confidence interval [1.08; 169.31], P = 0.043).{(barrett_Nutritionand?)

Muscle area on CT decreased by 6.1% over 3 months. Patients in the lowest tertile (loss of 9%) had worse survial. Overall survival 17.5 months for first-line chemotherapy and 8.5months for second-line. Baseline muscle density was predictive of survival on multivariable analysis, but low SMI at baseline was not associatesd with survival. (This may be because sarcopenic obesity is the major risk factor, and there were few obese patients in the study cohort) &gt;Muscle loss of 9% or more remained independently associated with survival when adjusted for sex, age, baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, comorbidity, mono-organ or multiorgan metastases, treatment line, and tumor progression at first evaluation by computed tomography scan (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.21 to 9.05; P , .001). We found a mean coefficient of variation between observers of 0.6% for skeletal muscle area in a random sample of 20 patients, which is regarded to be low.(MacDonald, Greig, and Baracos 2011). Changes between the first and second scans were calculated as a rate of change per 3 months, meaning change per first evaluation, to compare with available literature.[awad74][prado1583]Relative muscle change per 3 months was categorized into tertiles of muscle change: tertile one, highest muscle loss up to 9%; tertile two, muscle loss of 9% to 1.5%; and tertile three, muscle loss of 1.5% until highest gain in muscle. However, the survival curve of tertile two was not significantly different from the survival curve of tertile three (log-rank P = .961); therefore tertiles two and three were pooled (cutoff, 9% muscle loss).\nAwad (Awad et al. 2012)studies changes in body composition during neodjuvant chemotherapy for esophagogastric cancer.\nKurk (Kurk et al. 2020) found that skeletal muscle loss during chemotherapy was associated with decreased progression-free and overall- survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nDetailed changes in skeletal muscle mass and body weight during CAIRO3 treatments were previously reported.KurkS, p909, 2018) We additionally analyzed changes in SMI and BMI during these treatments by linear mixed effects models.(Bayar MA,p311,2017) The baseline value of the outcome (SMI/BMI) was included in the outcome vector. Potential confounders were age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, best response to initial six cycles CAPOX‐B, resection of the primary tumor, and the number of metastatic sites. The final model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and included: treatment arm, time, age, sex, resection primary tumor, and the interaction of treatment arm by time as fixed effects. Modeling time as a random effect did not increase the model fit as indicated by the AIC. To investigate differences in SMI and BMI changes over time between the CAIRO3 treatment arms, we checked the significance of the two‐way interaction including treatment arm by time.\n\n\nDuring p2 (maintenance CAP‐B/observation), again absolute SMI and BMI at the start (t1) of treatment were not associated with early progression and death. In contrast, SMI loss and BMI loss during treatment were associated with early progression and death.\n\nFogelman (Fogelman et al. 2014) treated patients undergoing chemotherapy with a novel agent designed to reduce muscle less. CT scans at 2 months were compared with baseline scans prior to chemotherapy.\n\nChanges in skeletal muscle were determined using routinely acquired CT scans for patients on the study. We calculated skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). A single slice at the mid-point of L3 was used, preferably a 2.5-mm slice if available, and a 5-mm slice if a 2.5-mm slice was not available. The L3 is a landmark that has been extensively used and validated in studies assessing body composition in cancer patients [Shen et al. (2004)](C. M. M. Prado, Birdsell, and Baracos 2009) . Skeletal muscle surface areas were determined using Slice-o-Matic softwareTM, version 4.3 (Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada) using pre-established thresholds of Hounsfield units (HU) of −29 to +150 (Mitsiopoulos et al. 1998). We additionally evaluated adipose tissue cross-sectional area (subcutaneous, visceral, and intramuscular) in the L3 region as described previously (Mourtzakis et al. 2008). Changes in muscle and adipose tissue surface areas over time were determined for each patient from the baseline study to the first CT post treatment, done after 2 months. We looked at muscle loss as a continuous variable and defined “meaningful loss” as greater than a 6 cm2 difference from the baseline to the second scan. We chose this cut point as it is equivalent to 1 kg of skeletal muscle and is associated with physical function (i.e., muscle strength). Additionally, this cut point has been used to investigate significant changes in muscle mass throughout cancer disease trajectory [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al. 1988)(C. M. Prado et al. 2013).\n\nPrado (C. M. Prado et al. 2013) looked at changes in 1279 CT scans in 368 patients with advanced cancer. The last available interval with CT scans was chosen for comparison. Categorized into stable, gaining, losing for muscle and for adipose tissue. Adipose tissue was ?? sum of visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous tissue. (Did not use SMI). Muscel loss and adipose loss seemed correlated, with larger magnitude of adipose tissue loss at short interval to death. (Authors conclusion that muscle and adipose tissue loss in the past 3 months of life is likely not possible) &gt;Advanced-cancer patients (n = 368; median survival: 196 d) had a total of 1279 CT images over the course of their disease. With consideration of all time points, muscle loss occurred in 39% of intervals between any 2 scans. However, the overall frequency of muscle gain was 15.4%, and muscle was stable in 45.6% of intervals between any 2 scans, which made the maintenance or gain of muscle the predominant behavior. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that being within 90 d (compared with &gt;90 d) from death was the principal risk factor for muscle loss (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.94; P = 0.002), and muscle gain was correspondingly less likely (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.69; P = 0.002) at this time. Sex, age, BMI, and tumor group were not significant predictors of muscle loss or gain. A much higher proportion of men (61%) than women (31%) met the criteria for sarcopenia. Changes in muscle and adipose tissue over time were calculated as the absolute loss or gain of tissue area during each scan interval. The precision error of measurements was ~1.5% (Mourtzakis et al. 2008) with a minimum detectable change of ~3 cm2. We attributed the change during each interval into the following categories: 1) muscle loss ≥6.0 cm2, 2) stable muscle ±5.9 cm2, or 3) muscle gain ≥6.0cm2. These cutoffs are equivalent to a loss or gain of ≥1 kg of skeletal muscle on a whole-body basis and are associated with alterations in muscle strength [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al. 1988). For adipose tissue, categories were based on the equivalence of 14.7 cm2 total fat at L3 and 1 kg tissue on a whole-body basis (Shen et al. 2004); therefore, changes during each interval were categorized as 1) adipose tissue loss ≥14.7 cm2, 2) stable adipose tissue ±14.6 cm2, or 3) adipose tissue gain ≥14.7 cm2. CT scans were taken for the diagnosis, confirmation of stage, and follow-up of disease progression and treatment. With the understanding that cachexia evolves markedly in the end of life and to take advantage of repeated measures, we focused on patients with ≥2 CT images (2–6 images) on record during the year preceding their deaths (n = 368). A selection bias was not apparent in this sample; we showed that the sex distribution, age at death, survival time, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, and body-composition features (ie, muscle and adipose tissues) in patients who had only a single scan were not different from those of the overall cohort at an equal time to death (P &gt; 0.1). Patients included in the analysis (n = 368) were of advanced stage, and the median time to death of all groups was &lt;1 y.\nSimilar study by Tan looking at longitudinal body composition in pancreatic cancer (Tan et al. 2009). 111 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer: 44 identified with more than one scan. Patients who underwent repeated CT scans were more likely to receive active therapy (71%) and had longer survival than those who had a solitary CT scan (28% receiving active chemotherapy). OVeral median survival 130 days. Age and sarcopenic obesity predicted survival. Sarcopenic obesity had survival of 55 days vs 148 days for those without sarcopenia obesity. Muscle loss was normalized to percent during 100 days. Median interval between scans was ??135 days. Patients grouped in tertiles for muscle gain/loss. Top tertile gained 7% muscle cross-sectional area/100 days, while bottom tertile lost 12% over 100 days. All tertiles lost adipose tissue. No difference in survival between the tertiles. &gt; muscle loss was the prevalent behavior, but 14% of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (considered the disease most highly associated with cachexia) exhibited a muscle gain of 7.9 ± 14.4%/100 d).\nLieffers and advanced colorectal cancer: Found liver and spleen increased in size in terminal patients (causing increase in basal metabolic rate). Found more rapid muscle loss with progressive disease (Lieffers et al. 2009). Different thresholds for VAT (-150 to -50) and SAT(-190 to -30). Also estimated muscel surface area using measurements 5cm above L4(Shen et al. 2004). Most rapid change in body composition between 4 months and 1 month prior to death. &gt;14% of patients gained skeletal muscle during the year preceding death from colorectal cancer (+4.7 ± 5.4%/100 d).\nLongitudinal study of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (all with &lt;1yr survival). (Baracos et al. 2010) &gt;At referral (median time to death: 265 d), mean body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) was 24.9, with 47.4% of patients being overweight or obese. Only 7.5% overall were underweight as conventionally understood (BMI &lt; 18.5). Analysis of computed tomography images showed extremely high heterogeneity of muscle mass within all strata of BMI. The overall prevalence of severe muscle depletion (sarcopenia) was 46.8% and was present in patients in all BMI categories.\nCaan (Caan et al. 2017) examined body composition and survival from colorecal cncer at Kaiser.\n\n\nBody composition and gastric cancer\nPMID 34774016"

    "text": "Sarcopenia Methods Sarcopenia in GI Cancers Sarcopenia in Chemotherapy Esophageal Cancer Therapy\nThe patient with esophageal cancer faces multiple challenges in changes in body composition related to both muscle mass and adipose tissue. Patients frequently present with loss of adipose tissue and muscle from dysphaghia due to the primary tumor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation can improve oral intake due to tumor shrinkage, but can also decrease oral nutrition due to esophagitis and the catabolic effects of cytotoxic therapy.  In addition, patients undergoing esophagectomy frequently lose weight due to limited oral intake and the catabolic effects of the stress of surgery.\nFor patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy, the chemoradiation treatment prior to surgery can be seen as a ‘stress test’ which can further assist in evaluating a patient’s resilience to the stress of surgery.\nThe coexistence of sarcopenia and obesity has led to the identification of a syndrome of sarcopenia obesity, defined as sarcopenia in the context of a BMI &gt;30kg/m^2. These patients suffer the consequences of both loss of muscle mass with excess adipose tissue, which appear to act synergistically to decrease survival in cancer patients.(Prado et al. 2008) (Martin et al. 2013)\n\n\n\n\nA Japanese group of 190 patients undergoing esophagectomy were studied.

While sarcopenia in patients under age 65 was not associated with adverse outcomes, among 166 patients over age 65, sarcopenia was associated with increased risk of anastomotic leak and in-hospital mortality. Sarcopenia was defined: SMI of ≤ 39cm2/m2 for women and ≤ 55cm2/m2 for men\nAmong 98 Japanese patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, 31 (31%) were found to be sarcopenic.

Among these patients the 90-day readmission rate was 42.9% vs 16% in those without sarcopenia(Makiura et al. 2018).

    "text": "Disparities in receipt of surgery\n(Bliton et al., 2021) NCDB observed Black-White difference in receipt of surgery persists on multivariable adjustment via GLM with adjusted ORs of 0.87 (050–0.64) for esophagus, 0.53 (0.48–0.57) for DEGC. Adjusted for patient factors including histology. Receipt of surgery was strongly associated with survival.\nSEER Trends in esophageal cancer: (Corona et al., 2021) The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC = 1.60, p = 0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC = - 4.53, p &lt; 0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity.\nSEER no survival difference based upon race (Tramontano et al., 2018) T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p &lt; 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors.\nNCDB comparison of hospitals (Sridhar et al., 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Could preferential use of High Burden Hospitals by racial minorities account for their worse outcomes?\nMichigan Cancer Registry marital status at the time of diagnosis (Paniagua Cruz et al., 2020) 88.4% of our patients were White and 11.6% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9% v 31.8%, respectively; P &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment.Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes. Marital status at dx is a field in the CR Star data!!\nNCDB (Schlottmann et al., 2020) NCDB Stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. but was histology included in their model? Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. Is the negative effect on survival due to race or insurance status/geography?\nNCDB stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015 (Savitch et al., 2021) matched cohorts White:Black. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization. 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival. Another way of studying access to surgical care - this time at the facility level. Further support for the theme that access to surgery is barrier to optimal esophageal cancer care. Did this study account for histology? What about SES?\n(Swords et al., 2020) NCDB 2003-2011 Stage I-III esophageal cancer. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, *SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not.**\n(Erhunmwunsee et al., 2017) NCDB stage I-III 2003-2011. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. Did study include histology in their model?\n(Okereke et al., 2021) NCDB 2004-2017: 127,098 patients. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery). Surgery less often in Black patients but no correction for histology.\nCalifornia Cancer Registry (Tran et al., 2017) Esophageal cancer cases 2004-2010. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Sounds like receipt of surgery remains disparate based upon race and accounts for some differences in outcome"

    "text": "Disparities in access to surgical care\n(Greenstein et al., 2008) SEER:  1522 patients were included in the study. Blacks had worse esophageal-specific survival rates than whites (37% vs 60% 5-year survival; P &lt; .0001). Blacks were more likely to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage and to have squamous cell tumors, but were less likely to undergo surgery. In multivariate regression controlling for age, sex, marital status, histology, and tumor location, black race was associated with worse survival. When tumor status, surgery, and radiotherapy were added to the model, race was no longer significantly associated with survival.\n(dong257?) SEER-Medicare Matched patients with esophageal cancer. The absolute difference in 5-year survival between black patients (13.3%) and NHW patients (18.4%) was 5.1% (95% CI, 2.3%-7.7%; P = .001) in the demographics match. After we matched for presentation, the difference in 5-year survival was reduced to 2.3% (95% CI, 0.3%-4.8%), but remained statistically significant (P = .04). Additional matching of patients on treatment-related factors eliminated the racial difference in 5-year survival (P = .59). Among patients matched for disease presentation, only 10.8% of black patients underwent surgery, compared with 22.8% of NHW patients (P &lt; .001). Histology, tumor location, socioeconomic status, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy each were associated with the receipt of surgery. None of these factors, however, could explain the racial difference in the receipt of surgery.\n(Al-Refaie et al., 2012) Using the 2003-2008 National Inpatient Sample, we identified 59,841 patients who underwent cancer operations for lung, esophagus, and pancreas tumors. Logistic regression models were used to examine the impact of sociodemographic factors on receipt of complex cancer surgery at LVH. Overall, 38.4% received their cancer surgery at LVH. A higher proportion of esophagectomies were performed at LVH (70.3%), followed by pancreatectomy (38.2%) and lung resection (33.8%). Patients who were non-white, with non-private insurance, and had more comorbidities were all more likely to receive their cancer surgery at LVH (for all, p &lt; 0.05). Multivariate analyses continued to demonstrate that non-white race, insurance status, increased comorbidities, region, and nonelective admission predicted receipt of cancer surgery at LVH across all 3 procedures.\nReview of social disparities in treatment of esophageal cancer (Delman et al., 2021)\n(Dimick et al., 2013) Black patients more likely to undergo surgery at low-quality hospitals\nNorth Carolina (Wong et al., 2021) compared per capita rate of surgery in 5 high-resource counties with 5 low-resource counties using is data from the Health Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database from 2016. Using the surgical rate observed in the 5 highest-ranked counties (HRCs), the expected surgical rate in the 5 lowest-ranked counties (LRCs) in North Carolina were calculated. Patients 18 years and older who underwent an inpatient general surgery procedure and patients who underwent emergency inpatient cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy, or bariatric surgery in 2016 were included. The primary outcome was the proportional surgical ratio (PSR), which was the disparity in surgical access defined as the observed number of surgical procedures in the 5 LRCs relative to the expected number of procedures using the 5 HRCs as the standardized reference population. In 2016, approximately 1.9 million adults lived in the 5 HRCs, while approximately 246 854 lived in the 5 LRCs. A total of 28 924 inpatient general surgical procedures were performed, with 4521 being performed in those living in the 5 LRCs and 24 403 in those living in the 5 HRCs. The rate of general surgery in the 5 HRCs was 13.09 procedures per 1000 population. Using the 5 HRCs as the reference, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.35-1.44). For emergent/urgent cholecystectomy, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 2.26 (95% CI, 2.02-2.51), and the PSR for emergent/urgent herniorrhaphy was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.33-2.45). Age-adjusted rate of obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] greater than 30), on average, was 36.6% (SD, 3.4) in the 5 LRCs vs 25.4% (SD, 4.6) in the 5 HRCs (P = .002). The rate of bariatric surgery in the 5 HRCs was 33.07 per 10 000 population with obesity. For the 5 LRCs, the PSR was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.51-0.69). Could we use this same database for esophagectomy? Need to figure out whether patients that have surgery in an read different from where they live are scored as their county of residence or county where surgery was done\n(degajer276?)\nThoracic surgeons (Alvarado et al., 2023) Black\nThe Premier Healthcare Database was used to identify adult inpatients receiving esophagectomy categorized as receiving their esophagectomy from a thoracic versus non-thoracic provider. During the study period, 960 patients met inclusion criteria representing an estimated population size of 3894 patients. Among them, 1696 (43.5%) were performed by a thoracic surgeon and 2199 (56.5%) were performed by non-thoracic providers. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with decreased likelihood of receiving care from a thoracic provider included Black (OR 0.41, p &lt; 0.001), Other (OR 0.21, p &lt; 0.001), and Unknown race (OR 0.22, p = 0.04), and uninsured patients (OR 0.53, p = 0.03). Urban hospital setting was associated with an increased likelihood of care by a thoracic provider (OR 4.43, p = 0.001)."

    "text": "Body composition and Racial/Ethnic differences\nAge - Sex - Race body composition standard Curves(Magudia et al., 2021)\nBackground Although CT-based body composition (BC) metrics may inform disease risk and outcomes, obtaining these metrics has been too resource intensive for large-scale use. Thus, population-wide distributions of BC remain uncertain. Purpose To demonstrate the validity of fully automated, deep learning BC analysis from abdominal CT examinations, to define demographically adjusted BC reference curves, and to illustrate the advantage of use of these curves compared with standard methods, along with their biologic significance in predicting survival. Materials and Methods After external validation and equivalency testing with manual segmentation, a fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was applied to a cross-sectional population cohort that included any outpatient without a cardiovascular disease or cancer who underwent abdominal CT examination at one of three hospitals in 2012. Demographically adjusted population reference curves were generated for each BC area. The z scores derived from these curves were compared with sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia by using χ2 tests and used to predict 2-year survival in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included weight and body mass index (BMI). Results External validation showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99) and equivalency (P &lt; .001) of the fully automated deep learning BC analysis method with manual segmentation. With use of the fully automated BC data from 12 128 outpatients (mean age, 52 years; 6936 [57%] women), age-, race-, and sex-normalized BC reference curves were generated. All BC areas varied significantly with these variables (P &lt; .001 except for subcutaneous fat area vs age [P = .003]). Sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia demonstrated that age and race bias were not present if z scores derived from the reference curves were used (P &lt; .001). Skeletal muscle area z scores were significantly predictive of 2-year survival (P = .04) in combined models that included BMI. Conclusion Fully automated body composition (BC) metrics vary significantly by age, race, and sex. The z scores derived from reference curves for BC parameters better capture the demographic distribution of BC compared with standard methods and can help predict survival. Investigators at the University of Illinois {Jang et al. (2020)} examined the change in skeletal muscle index during cancer treatment among 212 patients. Among 132 non-Hispanic Black patients, muscle loss during therapy was greater than non-Hispanic White and Other (Asian + Hispanic) (Odds Ratio 3.29 p=0.004). The loss was highest in Black rectal cancer patients (11 units of SMI loss cm2/m2) vs White rectal Cancer (8 cm2/m2). Loss among colon cancer patients was higher in Black patients ( 5.5 cm2/m2) than in White patients (2.5 cm2/m2). Prior to treatment, Blacks had higher SMI than White (similar to findings of Xaio 2019)\nData from Kaiser (xaio615?) examined 3263 patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer. Black patients had higher lower rates of sarcopenia according to the definition of Prado et al. Patients with higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio had higher risk of muscle abnormality. CT scan at L3 was analyed to determine SMI,IMAT,VAT,SAT and TAT (=VAT+SAT+IMAT) using SliceOMatic. Threshold values determined for optimal stratification (cf (martin153?)

    "text": "(Bliton et al., 2021) NCDB observed Black-White difference in receipt of surgery persists on multivariable adjustment via GLM with adjusted ORs of 0.87 (050–0.64) for esophagus, 0.53 (0.48–0.57) for DEGC. Adjusted for patient factors including histology. Receipt of surgery was strongly associated with survival.\nSEER Trends in esophageal cancer: (Corona et al., 2021) The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC = 1.60, p = 0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC = - 4.53, p &lt; 0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity.\nSEER no survival difference based upon race (Tramontano et al., 2018) T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p &lt; 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors.\nNCDB comparison of hospitals (Sridhar et al., 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Could preferential use of High Burden Hospitals by racial minorities account for their worse outcomes?\nMichigan Cancer Registry marital status at the time of diagnosis (Paniagua Cruz et al., 2020) 88.4% of our patients were White and 11.6% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9% v 31.8%, respectively; P &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment.Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes. Marital status at dx is a field in the CR Star data!!\nNCDB (Schlottmann et al., 2020) NCDB Stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. but was histology included in their model? Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. Is the negative effect on survival due to race or insurance status/geography?\nNCDB stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015 (Savitch et al., 2021) matched cohorts White:Black. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization. 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival. Another way of studying access to surgical care - this time at the facility level. Further support for the theme that access to surgery is barrier to optimal esophageal cancer care. Did this study account for histology? What about SES?\n(Swords et al., 2020) NCDB 2003-2011 Stage I-III esophageal cancer. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, *SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not.**\n(Erhunmwunsee et al., 2017) NCDB stage I-III 2003-2011. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. Did study include histology in their model?\n(Okereke et al., 2021) NCDB 2004-2017: 127,098 patients. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery). Surgery less often in Black patients but no correction for histology.\nCalifornia Cancer Registry (Tran et al., 2017) Esophageal cancer cases 2004-2010. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Sounds like receipt of surgery remains disparate based upon race and accounts for some differences in outcome\n\n\n\nAmong 565 124 adult patients who underwent surgical resection of a gastrointestinal tract cancer, 10.9% were Black patients, 83.5% were White patients, Longer median survival was associated with negative resection margins (87.3 [IQR, 28.5-161.9] months vs 22.9 [IQR, 8.8-69.2] months; P &lt; .001) and adequate lymphadenectomies (80.7 [IQR, 25.6 to not reached] months vs 57.6 [IQR, 17.7-153.8] months; P &lt; .001). After adjustment for covariates, Black patients were less likely than White patients to have negative surgical margins after esophagectomy (OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.58-0.87]), Black patients were also less likely to have adequate lymphadenectomy after esophagectomy (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.63-0.83]), Black patients were more likely than White patients not to be recommended for chemotherapy (OR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.10-1.21]) and radiotherapy (OR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.35-1.64]) because of comorbidities and more likely not to receive recommended chemotherapy (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.551.82]) and radiotherapy (OR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.97-2.41]) for unknown reasons. (Bakkila et al., 2022)\n\n\n\n(Greenstein et al., 2008) SEER:  1522 patients were included in the study. Blacks had worse esophageal-specific survival rates than whites (37% vs 60% 5-year survival; P &lt; .0001). Blacks were more likely to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage and to have squamous cell tumors, but were less likely to undergo surgery. In multivariate regression controlling for age, sex, marital status, histology, and tumor location, black race was associated with worse survival. When tumor status, surgery, and radiotherapy were added to the model, race was no longer significantly associated with survival.\n(dong257?) SEER-Medicare Matched patients with esophageal cancer. The absolute difference in 5-year survival between black patients (13.3%) and NHW patients (18.4%) was 5.1% (95% CI, 2.3%-7.7%; P = .001) in the demographics match. After we matched for presentation, the difference in 5-year survival was reduced to 2.3% (95% CI, 0.3%-4.8%), but remained statistically significant (P = .04). Additional matching of patients on treatment-related factors eliminated the racial difference in 5-year survival (P = .59). Among patients matched for disease presentation, only 10.8% of black patients underwent surgery, compared with 22.8% of NHW patients (P &lt; .001). Histology, tumor location, socioeconomic status, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy each were associated with the receipt of surgery. None of these factors, however, could explain the racial difference in the receipt of surgery.\n(Al-Refaie et al., 2012) Using the 2003-2008 National Inpatient Sample, we identified 59,841 patients who underwent cancer operations for lung, esophagus, and pancreas tumors. Logistic regression models were used to examine the impact of sociodemographic factors on receipt of complex cancer surgery at LVH. Overall, 38.4% received their cancer surgery at LVH. A higher proportion of esophagectomies were performed at LVH (70.3%), followed by pancreatectomy (38.2%) and lung resection (33.8%). Patients who were non-white, with non-private insurance, and had more comorbidities were all more likely to receive their cancer surgery at LVH (for all, p &lt; 0.05). Multivariate analyses continued to demonstrate that non-white race, insurance status, increased comorbidities, region, and nonelective admission predicted receipt of cancer surgery at LVH across all 3 procedures.\nReview of social disparities in treatment of esophageal cancer (Delman et al., 2021)\n(Dimick et al., 2013) Black patients more likely to undergo surgery at low-quality hospitals\nNorth Carolina (Wong et al., 2021) compared per capita rate of surgery in 5 high-resource counties with 5 low-resource counties using is data from the Health Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database from 2016. Using the surgical rate observed in the 5 highest-ranked counties (HRCs), the expected surgical rate in the 5 lowest-ranked counties (LRCs) in North Carolina were calculated. Patients 18 years and older who underwent an inpatient general surgery procedure and patients who underwent emergency inpatient cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy, or bariatric surgery in 2016 were included. The primary outcome was the proportional surgical ratio (PSR), which was the disparity in surgical access defined as the observed number of surgical procedures in the 5 LRCs relative to the expected number of procedures using the 5 HRCs as the standardized reference population. In 2016, approximately 1.9 million adults lived in the 5 HRCs, while approximately 246 854 lived in the 5 LRCs. A total of 28 924 inpatient general surgical procedures were performed, with 4521 being performed in those living in the 5 LRCs and 24 403 in those living in the 5 HRCs. The rate of general surgery in the 5 HRCs was 13.09 procedures per 1000 population. Using the 5 HRCs as the reference, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.35-1.44). For emergent/urgent cholecystectomy, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 2.26 (95% CI, 2.02-2.51), and the PSR for emergent/urgent herniorrhaphy was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.33-2.45). Age-adjusted rate of obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] greater than 30), on average, was 36.6% (SD, 3.4) in the 5 LRCs vs 25.4% (SD, 4.6) in the 5 HRCs (P = .002). The rate of bariatric surgery in the 5 HRCs was 33.07 per 10 000 population with obesity. For the 5 LRCs, the PSR was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.51-0.69). Could we use this same database for esophagectomy?

Thus, population-wide distributions of BC remain uncertain. Purpose To demonstrate the validity of fully automated, deep learning BC analysis from abdominal CT examinations, to define demographically adjusted BC reference curves, and to illustrate the advantage of use of these curves compared with standard methods, along with their biologic significance in predicting survival. Materials and Methods After external validation and equivalency testing with manual segmentation, a fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was applied to a cross-sectional population cohort that included any outpatient without a cardiovascular disease or cancer who underwent abdominal CT examination at one of three hospitals in 2012. Demographically adjusted population reference curves were generated for each BC area. The z scores derived from these curves were compared with sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia by using χ2 tests and used to predict 2-year survival in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included weight and body mass index (BMI). Results External validation showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99) and equivalency (P &lt; .001) of the fully automated deep learning BC analysis method with manual segmentation. With use of the fully automated BC data from 12 128 outpatients (mean age, 52 years; 6936 [57%] women), age-, race-, and sex-normalized BC reference curves were generated. All BC areas varied significantly with these variables (P &lt; .001 except for subcutaneous fat area vs age [P = .003]). Sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia demonstrated that age and race bias were not present if z scores derived from the reference curves were used (P &lt; .001). Skeletal muscle area z scores were significantly predictive of 2-year survival (P = .04) in combined models that included BMI. Conclusion Fully automated body composition (BC) metrics vary significantly by age, race, and sex. The z scores derived from reference curves for BC parameters better capture the demographic distribution of BC compared with standard methods and can help predict survival. Investigators at the University of Illinois {Jang et al. (2020)} examined the change in skeletal muscle index during cancer treatment among 212 patients. Among 132 non-Hispanic Black patients, muscle loss during therapy was greater than non-Hispanic White and Other (Asian + Hispanic) (Odds Ratio 3.29 p=0.004). The loss was highest in Black rectal cancer patients (11 units of SMI loss cm2/m2) vs White rectal Cancer (8 cm2/m2). Loss among colon cancer patients was higher in Black patients ( 5.5 cm2/m2) than in White patients (2.5 cm2/m2).

    "text": "(Bliton et al., 2021) NCDB observed Black-White difference in receipt of surgery persists on multivariable adjustment via GLM with adjusted ORs of 0.87 (050–0.64) for esophagus, 0.53 (0.48–0.57) for DEGC. Adjusted for patient factors including histology. Receipt of surgery was strongly associated with survival.\nSEER Trends in esophageal cancer: (Corona et al., 2021) The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC = 1.60, p = 0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC = - 4.53, p &lt; 0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity.\nSEER no survival difference based upon race (Tramontano et al., 2018) T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p &lt; 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors.\nNCDB comparison of hospitals (Sridhar et al., 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Could preferential use of High Burden Hospitals by racial minorities account for their worse outcomes?\nMichigan Cancer Registry marital status at the time of diagnosis (Paniagua Cruz et al., 2020) 88.4% of our patients were White and 11.6% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9% v 31.8%, respectively; P &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment.Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes. Marital status at dx is a field in the CR Star data!!\nNCDB (Schlottmann et al., 2020) NCDB Stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. but was histology included in their model? Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. Is the negative effect on survival due to race or insurance status/geography?\nNCDB stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015 (Savitch et al., 2021) matched cohorts White:Black. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization. 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival. Another way of studying access to surgical care - this time at the facility level. Further support for the theme that access to surgery is barrier to optimal esophageal cancer care. Did this study account for histology? What about SES?\n(Swords et al., 2020) NCDB 2003-2011 Stage I-III esophageal cancer. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, *SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not.**\n(Erhunmwunsee et al., 2017) NCDB stage I-III 2003-2011. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. Did study include histology in their model?\n(Okereke et al., 2021) NCDB 2004-2017: 127,098 patients. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery). Surgery less often in Black patients but no correction for histology.\nCalifornia Cancer Registry (Tran et al., 2017) Esophageal cancer cases 2004-2010. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Sounds like receipt of surgery remains disparate based upon race and accounts for some differences in outcome"

Findings the ideal location for the tube involves laparoscopy with low insufflation pressure (4mm Hg), which allows adequate distention of the stomach with an endoscope. A neonatal (5mm) endoscope can be helpful. A site is selected at the midpoint of the stomach on a saggital plane to allow minimal tension on the tube. The tube is placed as far proximally on the stomach as possible yet still at least 3cm from the left costal margin (for patient comfort and to allow minimal tension on the gastrostomy tube).

Findings the ideal location for the tube involves laparoscopy with low insufflation pressure (4mm Hg), which allows adequate distention of the stomach with an endoscope. A neonatal (5mm) endoscope can be helpful. A site is selected at the midpoint of the stomach on a saggital plane to allow minimal tension on the tube. The tube is placed as far proximally on the stomach as possible yet still at least 3cm from the left costal margin (for patient comfort and to allow minimal tension on the gastrostomy tube).

Near infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green may be utilized to clearly identify and preserve the gastroepiploic arcade to its termination point.\nIn the setting of previous induction chemoradiation therapy, an omental flap based off of 2–3 omental perforating arteries may be harvested for later reinforcement of the gastroesophageal anastomosis.\nComplete gastric mobilization from the hiatus to the pylorus is performed. The gastric conduit is created with sequential applications of the endogastrointestinal stapler. The conduit is secured to the specimen for later traverse into the chest in proper orientation. The omental flap, if created, should be secured to the tip of the conduit to simplify transit into the chest as well."

Eight mm robotic ports are placed at the eighth intercostal space at the posterior axillary line, the third intercostal space in the mid to posterior axillary, fifth intercostal place into the mid axillary line, and at the ninth intercostal space approximately in line with the tip of the scapula. An assistant non-robotic port is placed at the site of the diaphragmatic insertion. Complete circumferential esophageal mobilization is performed from the level of the hiatus to the azygous vein with careful attention to harvest all periesophageal lymph node bearing tissues en bloc with the specimen. During dissection of the subcarinal lymph node packet, great care must be taken to avoid energy associated thermal injury to the membranous wall of the airways. Judicious use of both bipolar energy sources and non-energy dependent sharp and blunt dissection, and clear visualization and exposure of the dependent anatomy are critical to avoid these injuries which may result in esophageal/conduit airway fistulas. Additional mobilization of the esophagus towards the thoracic inlet is completed with careful attention to avoid traction or direct injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The conduit is delivered into the chest and sutured to the diaphragm. The caudal to cranial deep dissection along the contralateral pleura and left mainstem bronchus is completed with lateral retraction of the specimen once divided from the conduit."

A robotically placed running “baseball” suture is placed around the opening of the divided proximal esophagus, and the anvil of the 28 mm end to end anastomotic (EEA) stapler is inserted and secured. An additional reinforcing superficial purse string suture is placed to ensure tissue apposition around the stem of the anvil during deployment of the stapler. The EEA stapler is introduced through a gastrotomy site created in the proximal conduit tip, and the spike brought out through the lateral wall of the conduit ideally just above the level of the vascular arcade insertion. The stapler is then docked to the anvil and fired, creating the anastomosis, and the redundant conduit resected. If an omental flap has been harvested, it is loosely secured around the newly created anastomosis at this time. A drain is left posterior to the conduit and a chest tube is left in the right pleural space.\nVideo"
