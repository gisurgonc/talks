## Robotic MIE - Challenges

Conduit construction

- Will intracorporeal stapler hamper conduit construction?
- Can we find a way to measure conduit length/blood supply?

Anastomosis

- Will hand-sewn anastomosis be as robust as stapled anastomosis?

Personnel

- Thoracic robot "privileges" 

## Robotic MIE - Phase 1

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

## Robotic MIE - Metrics

- Operative experience of residents
- Anastomotic leak
- Anastomotic stricture
  - Whether dilated or not
  - How many dilations
- Complications
  - Airway injury

## Personnel

Thoracic Surgery

- Jeff Hagen
- Mike Roach
- Mark Mitchell

No current thoracic surgery residency

# Patient Selection

- Low (distal) tumors
- Avoid tumor near carina
- Avoid bulky tumors at GE junction

## One Stage Esophagectomy

## Robotic MIE - Pittsburgh 1 

A midline 8 mm robotic port is placed at the level of the umbilicus. Three more 8 mm ports are placed in left and right mid clavicular line and at the left costal margins. A 5-mm non-robotic port is placed at the right costal margin through which a liver retractor is placed. A robotic bipolar forceps are used in the right midclavicular port, ultrasonic shears in the left midclavicular port and an atraumatic grasper in the leftmost costal port. An assistant 12 mm non-robotic port is placed in the right para umbilical position, as well as a second 5 mm assistant port further lateral in the same para umbilical line.

## Robotic MIE - Pittsburgh 2

The dissection is generally begun with division of the lesser omentum, initial assessment and mobilization of the crura and esophageal hiatus, and exposure of the left gastric vascular pedicle. Complete celiac axis lymphadenectomy is performed. The left gastric and short gastric vessels are divided and the gastroepiploic arcade preserved in its entirety during gastric mobilization. Near infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green may be utilized to clearly identify and preserve the gastroepiploic arcade to its termination point.

In the setting of previous induction chemoradiation therapy, an omental flap based off of 2–3 omental perforating arteries may be harvested for later reinforcement of the gastroesophageal anastomosis. 

Complete gastric mobilization from the hiatus to the pylorus is performed. The gastric conduit is created with sequential applications of the endogastrointestinal stapler. The conduit is secured to the specimen for later traverse into the chest in proper orientation. The omental flap, if created, should be secured to the tip of the conduit to simplify transit into the chest as well.


## Robotic MIE - Pittsburgh 3

A pyloroplasty is routinely performed in the majority of cases. The pylorus is open longitudinally with the ultrasonic shears and closed transversely with robotic suturing using interrupted sutures in a Heinicke-Mickulicz fashion. A feeding jejunostomy is placed and the abdominal portion concluded. The specimen is secured to the conduit and the abdominal portion is concluded.


## Robotic MIE - Pittsburgh 4

The patient is placed  left lateral decubitus. CO2 insufflation is initiated with an entry needle just below the tip of the scapula. Eight mm robotic ports are placed at the eighth intercostal space at the posterior axillary line, the third intercostal space in the mid to posterior axillary, fifth intercostal place into the mid axillary line, and at the ninth intercostal space approximately in line with the tip of the scapula. An assistant non-robotic port is placed at the site of the diaphragmatic insertion. Complete circumferential esophageal mobilization is performed from the level of the hiatus to the azygous vein with careful attention to harvest all periesophageal lymph node bearing tissues en bloc with the specimen. During dissection of the subcarinal lymph node packet, great care must be taken to avoid energy associated thermal injury to the membranous wall of the airways. Judicious use of both bipolar energy sources and non-energy dependent sharp and blunt dissection, and clear visualization and exposure of the dependent anatomy are critical to avoid these injuries which may result in esophageal/conduit airway fistulas. Additional mobilization of the esophagus towards the thoracic inlet is completed with careful attention to avoid traction or direct injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The conduit is delivered into the chest and sutured to the diaphragm. The caudal to cranial deep dissection along the contralateral pleura and left mainstem bronchus is completed with lateral retraction of the specimen once divided from the conduit.


## Robotic MIE - Pittsburgh 5

The esophagus is divided approximately 2–3 centimeters above the azygos vein, although more proximal division may be performed dependent on the margins necessary. A 4–5 cm access incision in made through the operator’s “left” hand robotic working port to deliver the specimen out of the chest. A robotically placed running “baseball” suture is placed around the opening of the divided proximal esophagus, and the anvil of the 28 mm end to end anastomotic (EEA) stapler is inserted and secured. An additional reinforcing superficial purse string suture is placed to ensure tissue apposition around the stem of the anvil during deployment of the stapler. The EEA stapler is introduced through a gastrotomy site created in the proximal conduit tip, and the spike brought out through the lateral wall of the conduit ideally just above the level of the vascular arcade insertion. The stapler is then docked to the anvil and fired, creating the anastomosis, and the redundant conduit resected. If an omental flap has been harvested, it is loosely secured around the newly created anastomosis at this time. A drain is left posterior to the conduit and a chest tube is left in the right pleural space.

## Robotic MIE with stapled anastomosis



## "Corkscrew" position - One Stage

Allows simultaneous access to abdomen and chest in one prep

Divide esophagus in chest  $\rightarrow$ extra-corporeal construction of conduit $\rightarrow$ Anastomosis

Extracorporeal construction of conduit:

- Less risk of positive distal margin
- Longer conduit (stretch during construction)
