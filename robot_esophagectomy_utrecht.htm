<p>Conduit and esophagus opened anterior to staple lines, which are incorporated into the staple line. Take care to ensure incision length is the same on conduit vs esophagus.</p>
<p>Next the lumen of the esophagus is held up with a Cadiere Forceps by the da Vinci, while the assistant exposes the gastric tube in order to minimize the tension on the tissue . The second layer of the back wall is created by a running Stratafix Spiral® 3-0 (SH) suture placed transmural. The suture is started dorsally (9 o’clock position) and continued to ventrally (3o’clock) via the 6 o’clock position with the needle inside-out on the esophagus and outside-in on the gastric conduit. The knot is placed extraluminally.</p>
<p><img data-src="images/UGIRA60b.png"></p>
<h3 id="section"></h3>
<p>The anterior front wall is closed with 2 Stratafix Spiral 3-0 sutures starting one each at the dorsal and ventral edge of the remaining opening. The first suture is started dorsally (9 o’clock) and run to the middle of the opening at 12 o’clock. The second suture is run from ventrally 3 o´clock finishing ventral at 12 o´clock, meeting the first suture line. The securing knot is placed extraluminally.</p>

<p>The previously mobilized mediastinal pleura is closed with either single stitches or a running suture on top of anastomosis starting at azygos stump for about 4 cm distal, and pulling in small piece of omentum for protection. This enables fixation of the gastric tube and reinforcement of the anastomosis.</p>
<h3 id="linear-stapled-anastomosis">Linear Stapled Anastomosis</h3>
<p>The esophageal stump is opened on the (right side) within the middle with cold scissors or monopolar cautery hook proximal to the transecting stapler line</p>
<p>The site for linear stapler insertion is measured to be at least 6 cm distal to the transecting staple line on the gastric conduit. The incision is made using monopolar cautery close to the gastroepiploic arcade</p>
<p>Four retraction sutures are placed (dorsal, ventral, medial and lateral) around the opened esophageal lumen, making sure to fixate the mucosa to the rest of the esophageal wall. These retraction sutures will serve for applying optimal retraction on the stump for anastomotic suturing as well as help guide the esophageal stump over the stapler anvil.</p>
<p>The EndoWrist stapler anvil and cartridge jaw (30 mm length) are inserted into the appropriate lumens while the console surgeon guides the tissue onto the stapler with the da Vinci instruments. Once sufficient tissue overlap is achieved (approximately 60 mm) the stapler is fired (blue reload) and the gastric conduit and esophageal stump are connected dorsally side-to-side</p>

<p>A robot-assisted, single-layer running, <strong>hand-sewn technique</strong> was applied to first close the posterior wall and then the anterior wall by two separate suturing wires that were placed in identical direction to end at the same site (i.e.&nbsp;from 9 to 3 o’clock). If possible, the tip of the gastric conduit was removed, and an omental wrap was positioned around the anastomosis. The surgical technique was refined during the inclusion period. The first 13 cases were end-to-end (E-T-E) anastomoses. After consecutive case 13, a transit was made to an end-toside (E-T-S) anastomosis in order to be able to better tailor the level of the anastomosis at the level of the gastric tube. Furthermore, at consecutive case 18, the surgical team switched from using V-Loc 3.0 barbed suture wires (Medtronic) to Stratafix 3.0 (Ethicon) barbed suture wires. The reason for the change was that the more rigid v-lock suture could damage the esophageal wall at the level of the stiches. Starting with consecutive case 21, four supportive stitches were placed in the esophagus (i.e.&nbsp;at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock) before initiating the suturing. Finally, to avoid traction on the anastomosis, four tension-release stitches (i.e.&nbsp;at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock) were placed in the serosa of the esophagus and gastric conduit from consecutive case 47 onward. Consequently, the final anastomotic technique involved an E-T-S intrathoracic anastomosis that was created by the successive placement of four supportive stitches, single layer continuous suturing of the posterior and anterior wall with two separate Stratafix wires, four tension release stiches and an omental wrap. The incision in the gastric conduit for creating the anastomosis was made as far as possible from the longitudinal staple line and near the omentum.</p>
<p><strong>Circular stapled anastomosis</strong>: The creation of the gastric tube is deliberately incomplete. The small gastric curvature later serves to introduce the circular stapling device in the thoracic part of the operation and is resected afterward. From our point of view, the main advantage of this method is the possibility to determine the needed length of the gastric tube in the thoracic part of the operation. The anastomosis begins with the introduction of the circular stapler anvil in the transected esophageal stump. The fixation of the anvil is secured by a pursestring suture (Stratafix 3.0). For this fixation, we use a barbed suture, which delivers a very good result especially with the robot.19 For this purpose, the bougie (24Ch) that was introduced to prevent an esophageal spasm is withdrawn. The minor curvature is now brought to the thoracic wall and incised through the assistant port. A circular stapling device with a diameter of 29 mm can now be inserted. Now, a suitable location for anastomosis can be selected near the greater curvature. Here, particular attention should be paid to the correct length of the gastric tube: the anastomosis should not be under tension, but a gastric tube that is too long can lead to emptying disorders postoperatively due to the formation of a siphon and might be not well perfused. For that reason, routinely fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green is performed to ensure adequate perfusion of the gastric tube. After selecting the appropriate location, the mandrel is extended and connected to the anvil. An assistant puts the gastric tube under slight tension and completes the anastomosis. After insertion of a bougie past the anastomosis, the minor curvature is transected with a linear stapling device, and the specimen is salvaged via the assistant port. This is followed by the circular stitch over of the anastomosis and the proximal row of the gastric staple line. It can be helpful to change the camera to arm 2, resulting in a superior overview and improved freedom of movement for the bedside surgeon.</p>

<p>MIE collected series of 646 cases of Ivor Lewis esophagectomy found plateau of anastomotic leak at 8% <span class="citation" data-cites="vanworkum88">(<a href="#/references" role="doc-biblioref" onclick="">Workum et al., 2019</a>)</span>. Cases from from European center. his study included 646 patients. Three of the 4 hospitals reached the plateau of 8% anastomotic leakage. The length of the learning curve was 119 cases. The mean incidence of anastomotic leakage decreased from 18.8% during the learning phase to 4.5% after the plateau had been reached (P &lt; 0.001). Thirty-six extra patients (10.1% of all patients operated on during the learning curve) experienced learning associated anastomotic leakage, that could have been avoided if patients were operated by surgeons who had completed the learning curve. The incidence of textbook outcome increased from 28% to 53% and the mean operative time decreased from 344 minutes to 270 minutes.</p>
