### Time Out

Operation header on consent

**Time Out**

Review:

-   Consent
-   Comorbidities, including cardiopulmonary disease
-   Anticoagulation plan. If preoperative heparin was held for epidural, plans for timing of its administration. Circulator and anesthetist set alarms.
-   Prior abdominal or thoracic operations
-   Allergies
-   Blood
    -   Surgeon’s expectation of blood loss
    -   Availability of blood (type/screen vs type/cross).
    -   Blood product administration limitations, if any
-   Introduction by name and role
-   Co-surgeons: Confirm availability prior to incision
-   Operative plan
-   Request ICU bed in STICU

*Comorbidities:*

Cardiopulmonary disease. If echo, ejection fraction and aortic valve area (if abnormal)

Beta blockage: Note whether patient on home beta blockade and if so, whether home medication was taken the morning of surgery.

Anticipated Intraop Problems:

-   Possibility of tension left pneumothorax due to carbon dioxide entry into left chest during mediastinal dissection
-   Expectation of ventilatory difficulties due to carbon dioxide entry into the right chest Gastric mobilization – Greater Curvature

## Laparoscopy

Pneumoperitoneum established with Veress needle at left subcostal or inferior to umbilicus *or* modified Hasson approach. Abdominal entry with 5mm optical port at future location of Port #2 in mid-axillary line at level of umbilicus. Laparoscopy to look for peritoneal implants.

## Abdominal Phase

### Lesser Sac Dissection

Gastrohpeatic ligament divided. Celiac axis evaluated for resectability. Right crus dissected to ensure resectability. Dissection carried anteriorly and left crural dissection begun. Dissection posterior to esophagus.

Central node dissection begun, including common hepatic, left gastric, celiac, and proximal splenic aftery nodes. If replaced left hepatic artery present, may require preservation of left gastric artery. Left gastric artery divided with clips.

Posterior gastric dissection. Dissection is carried posterior towards most superior short gastric arteries (as these can be difficult to approach from the greater curvature side).

## Distal Greater curvature Dissection

The right gastroepiploic artery is identified and the lesser sac entere to the left of midline. Dissection proceeds to the patient's right. This may require shifting ports:

-   Camera to Port 2
-   Vessel sealer to Port 3
-   Tip Up to Port 4

Right gastroepiploic artery carefully preserved and gatrocolic omentum incised. Dissection proceeds to right to mobilize colon off duodenum. Kocher maneuver performed and omental adhesions to gallbladder taken down.

## Proximal Greater Curvature Dissection

Instruments are returned to original positions and dissection proceeds proximally, preserving the left gastroepiploic artery near its orgin. Posterior dissection from the pancreas and splenic artery is performed, followed by division of short gastric vessels

## Mediastinal dissection

Penrose drain is placed around esophagus and secured with stapler or Weck clips. Dissection proceeds to level of inferior pulmonary veins. Penrose is tucked into the mediastinum.

When Penrose is placed, confirm that heparin has been given.

## Pyloric Drainage - Pyloromyotimy (optional)

Pyloromyotomy is performed with camera in Port #2 and hook in Port #3 and Tip up in Port #4 (may need to move camera to midline)

## Pyloric Drainage - Pyloroplasty (optional)

Stay sutures of 2-0 silk are placed cephalad and caudad to pyorus. Pyloric incision is made with hook cautery. Defect is closed with 2-0 silk cut to 6" (have 2 sutures ready)

## Creation of Conduit

"Ruler" is created by making 1cm marks with black marker on Tip up. Tip up grasper place into Port #4. Robotic stapler is introduced into Port 2. Staple line starts \~5cm from pylorus. First firing with Green (4.8mm) stapler load followed by Blue loads. Conduit is created with goal of 3-4cm. Assistant retracts fundus towards left upper quadrant. Vicryl suture is placed 2cm above the start of the staple line (approximately 7cm from pylorus).

## Preparation of Conduit

Camera is moved to Port #2. Suture cut needle driver is introduced into Port 3 and Tip Up into Port 4. Conduit is sutured to specimen with multiple sutures of 2-0 silk (cut to 6"). Arm 4 is undocked and 19 Fr Blake drain is introduced through the port. The drain is sutured to specimen with 2-0 silk cut to 4"

**JP1??**

## Preparation for Thoracic Phase

Once conduit has been constructed, confirm presence in room of bean bag, two pillows, and an extra OR bed for transition to lateral decubitus position.

## Preparation for ICG

One vial of ICG is resuspended with 10mL of water. 5mL of the solution is brought onto the sterile field in a 5mL syringe, which is fitted with a 25Ga needle. The remainder of the ICG is given to Anesthesia for later (intravenous) use.

## Jejunostomy

Camera is moved to midline (or Port 2) and Tip up into Port 3. Camera re-oriented to 30 degrees up. Ligament of Treitz is identified and site for jejunostomy marked at 30cm with marking pen on a Prestige with 1 dot for selected site and 2 transverse marks distally. 3-0 Stratafix on RB-1 is introduced with a non-cutting needle driver into Port 3. Insufflation pressre reduced to Jejunum is sutured to abdominal wall starting at 10:00. Pursestring is run to 2:00 position and 16Ga needle from a 14Fr Cook Introducer kit passed through the abdominal wall into the bowel. Insufflation of air confirms proper position. J wire and 14FR dilator introduced and left in place. Pursestring continues around proposed site and then proceeds cephalad to provide a broader area of fixation between bowel and abdominal wall. Tract is dilated with 18Fr dilator. 14Fr MIC jejunostomy (trimmed to 10cm) is introduced through 18Fr sheath and positioned within the bowel. 5mL of water in a slip-tip (non-Luer) 10ml syringe (from the Cook introducer kit) are instilled into the jejunostomy balloon.

## Closure

Robot is disengaged and kept sterile. Laparoscopic cords are placed in a basin on a ring stand to be reused for the thoracic portion.

Abdomen is desufflated and ports removed. Port #2 site is closed by tying 0 Vicryl suture. Port sites are closed with 4-0 Monocryl followed by Dermabond.

## ICG injection into groin.

While port sites are being closed, "loincloth" is removed and hockey stick or small T ultrasound transducer is brought onto the field. Under ultrasound guidance with sterile ultrasound jelly, ICG is injected into groin nodes.



## Thoracic Phase

Patient is transferred to a spare OR table and a bean bag placed. Patient is positioned lateral with tip of scapula at break in the table. Pillows are used under and between the knees. Arm is supported on a Well Leg Holder affixed to the left headrail with a Yassargil clamp. Lateral positioners used on patient's left side to stabilize bean bag and allow tilt to the left (into modified prone position).

Lower and upper body bair hugger used. Right arm is elevated for prep and lowered once drapes in place.

## Prep and drape

Chloroprep including axilla and proximal right arm. Drape axilla/upper arm with 1000 drape.

Two blue "U" drapes used, folowed by trauma drape (or Universal). Ioban strips around edges. Once Ioban in place, arm is lowered

![](images/UGIRA22.jpg)

Laparoscopic instruments are kept sterile and may be returned to the field if pleural adhesions are encountered.

## Thoracic Ports

[ ](images/UGIRA22.jpg)

-   Arm #4 4th ICS 1cm medial to scapula
-   Arm #3 6th IS more medial than 4th arm and close to posterior axillary line. Camera Port.
-   Arm #2 8th ICS 12mm port for Vessel sealer or stapler
-   Arm #1 10th ICS on the scapular line or posterior on 10th ICS A1 Assitant 9th ICS triangulated beween 1 and 2. Alexis port used for extraction incision A2 Assistant 5th ICS.

DaVinci docking with "Anatomy: Renal" "Patient Right" Target on azygous vein

## Thoracic Dissection

1.  Dissect plane between lung and anterior aspect of esophagus. Start dissection at the pericardium and proceed cephalad. Once the area of the right mainstem bronchus is approached, keep plane more superficial.

2.  Dissect onto pericardium. Confirm that tumor will comes off pericardium. Leave pulmonary vein dissection to later. Counter traction with suction.

3.  Dissection over parietal pleura up to azygous arch superficially. Dissect lower aspect of the azygous vein.

4.  Superficial dissection superior to azygous vein to reach superior extent of dissection at inferior border of sygous svein, then proceed inferiorly along the posterior aspect of the esophagus. Dissection proceeds to hiatus.

5.  Divide azygous vein with either vascular load stapler or Gray load

6.  Dissection proceeds to hiatus

7.  Divide thoracic duct with Hem-O-Lock clips at least 5cm superior to hiatus.

8.  Return to dissection plane anterior to the esophagus and deepen plane. Leave dissection of Station 7 nodes until esophagus is completely freed up. Can switch instruments in Arm 1 and Arm 2.

9.  Dissection of Station 4R nodes.

10. Dissection of subcarinal (Station 7) nodes. Start by dissecting esophagus from trachea, then outline inferior border of right and left mainstem bronchi. Keep Station 7 lymph nodes on the specimen.

## Delivery of Conduit into chest

The conduit is delivered into the thorax. This is done using a laparoscopic graster. Ensure staple line faces you (right side). The specimen is removed through the assistant port incision. An Alexis port is used to seal the extraction site. Stomach is pulled into the chest until the **Vicryl marker suture** is seen.

Division of esophagus just above level of azygous vein. ICG can be used to check perfusion. If there is any question about the length of the conduit, confirm the length of the conduit prior to division of the esophagus.

Penrose drain is recovered. Specimen is sent for frozen section with instructions to freeze proximal margin.

Once conduit is delivered into chest, set up BK ultrasound to display on robotic screen.

## Preparation of conduit

The gastric conduit is placed into the mediastinum by tucking it medially from the right pleura into the posterior mediastinum, in order to allow the conduit to take the most direct path from the hiatus to the proximal esophagus. Gentle superior tension is now applied to the conduit in order to eliminate redundancy.

## Circular stapled anastomosis - Orvil

OrVil The OrVil device is now used to place a EEA anvil into the distal esophagus. In general, a 25mm size is selected, unless the patient has particularly small frame, in which case a 21mm size is used. Two stay sutures of 2-0 silk on RB-1 needles are placed in the center of the esophageal staple line 3mm apart. A Harmonic scalpel is used to divide the staple line. The OrVil device is passed through the mouth and is passed through the fenestration in the staple line. The anvil portion of the OrVil is oriented so that the rounded portion is placed against the roof of the mouth. The OrVil is guided into the hypopharynx by pulling on the the tube end of the device. As the anvil approaches the hypopharynx, the jaw is pulled forward to allow passage of the anvil.

The shaft of the anvil is brought through the esophageal staple line, and the tube disconnected from the anvil by cutting the blue sutures.

The superior end of the conduit is opened along the staple line and the DST XL stapler (matching the diameter of the OrVil) introduced through the Alexis device (Port #2). The stapler shaft is placed into the open end of the gastric conduit and the conduit pulled over it (‘sock over shoe’). The stapler spike is brought out through the greater curvature. The anvil is grasped with a Maryland grasper placed through a superior 5mm port and the two components of the stapler are mated and the stapler tightened and fired. The knob of the stapler is rotated two turns counter-clockwise until a click is felt, at which time the anvil will flip. The stapler is withdrawn and the donuts examined and sent for pathologic exam.

The anastomosis is completed by firing a 60mm Blue load across the conduit cephalad to the anastomosis. The excess conduit is retrieved through the Alexis port and sent for pathologic exam as ‘additional gastric margin.’

## Circular stapled anastomosis - Luketich

May be helpful to move camera back to Port #3 to see anastomosis better. May need to remove Port #1 for better visibility cephalad.

Esophagus divided with robotic shears.

Pursestring suture of 0 Prolene SH to depth of 3-5mm. Two robotic arms used to stretch esophagus laterally $\rightarrow$ anvil introduced into esophagus with large needle driver $\rightarrow$ pushed superiorly $\rightarrow$ oriented cephalad-caudad. Pursestring tied. Second pursestring of 0 Prolene placed inside of first.

DST XL 28mm EEA stapler introduced through port #2 (???) into open end of conduit $\rightarrow$ mated and fired. Anastomosis completed with linear stapler. Distance between anatomosis and final linear staple line should be 2cm.

## Linear Stapled Anastomosis

The esophageal stump is opened on the (right side) within the middle with cold scissors or monopolar cautery hook just proximal to the transecting stapler line

The site for linear stapler insertion is measured to be at least 6 cm distal to the transecting staple line on the gastric conduit. The incision is made using monopolar cautery close to the gastroepiploic arcade

Four retraction sutures are placed (dorsal, ventral, medial and lateral) around the opened esophageal lumen, making sure to fixate the mucosa to the rest of the esophageal wall. These retraction sutures will serve for applying optimal retraction on the stump for anastomotic suturing as well as help guide the esophageal stump over the stapler anvil.

The robotic stapler anvil and cartridge jaw (45mm? 60mm? length) are inserted into the appropriate lumens while the console surgeon guides the tissue onto the stapler. Once sufficient tissue overlap is achieved (approximately 60 mm) the stapler is fired (blue reload) and the gastric conduit and esophageal stump are connected dorsally side-to-side

34Fr gastric tube (?or Bougie) inserted. Anterior wall closed with two 4-0 Stratafix sutures run from each side toward the middle. Second later with 4-0 PDS

### Omental Flap

Omental flap is positioned between the conduit and airway and the anastomosis is loosely wrapped.

### NG tube

NG (Salem Sump silicone 18Fr tube) is passed by anesthetist. Robotic ultrasound used to confirm location. NG tube is advanced to 4th dot just about to enter the nose.

## Drains

38Fr Chest tube (Blake or Hollow-bore) placed. 19Fr Blake (JP2) postioned posterior to anastomosis.

## Closure

Extraction site closed with 0 Vicryl. Chest tube secured with 0 silk on SH needle. Skin incisions closed with 4-0 Monocyrl and Dermabond

### Abdominal Phase



Ports: 

Nathanson sub-xiphoid
Assistant port just below umbilicus
Port #1 (Cadiere) Right anterior axillary line
Port #2 Between Port #1 and midline. 12mm for stapler and vessel sealer
Port #3 Mirror image of Port #2. For Camera
Port #4 Left anterior axillary line. For Hook cautery (Right Hand)

Pars flaccida -> Right crus. Dissect out left gastric artery if large replaced left hepatic artery. 

Mobilize greater curvature

Vessel sealershort gastrics

1.  Division of gastroesophageal and phrenoesophageal ligaments and right crural dissection. An energy device is used to divide the gastrohepatic ligament and the esophagus is dissected from the right crus. Dissection is carried anteriorly where the phrenoesophageal ligament is divided. Disssection posterior to esophagus
2.  Division of left gastric artery and vein. Common hepatic artery nodes taken with specimen. The left gastric artery and vein are dissected and surrounding lymph nodes are swept toward the stomach; they can be removed at this time or with the specimen later. The artery and vein are divided with Weck clips or a vascular cartridge stapler. Posterior stomach dissected in medial to lateral fashion. RvH prefers to dissect left gastric from greater curvature side (posterior to stomach)
3.  Mediastinal dissection. A Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus, approximated to itself (ie with a stapler), and used for retraction to circumferentially dissect the mediastinal esophagus to the level of the inferior pulmonary veins. The Penrose is tucked into the mediastinum.
4.  Preparation of right gastroepiploic pedicle. The right gastroepiploic artery and vein are identified, the lesser sac is entered, and a healthy pedicle of right gastroepiploic adipose is created. Dissection continues towards the pylorus and then cranially along the stomach's greater curvature. Kocherize duodenum. Cadiere and Vessel sealer in left hand. 
5.  Creation of pedicled omental flap and division of short gastric arteries and veins. A pedicled omental flap is designed based on right gastroepiploic and short gastric arterial inflow, and the highest short gastric vessels are divided.
6.  Creation of gastric conduit. The lesser curvature adipose is divided between the caudal 2 branches of the right gastric artery and a 4-cm wide conduit is created with serial applications of green staple cartridges. The conduit is never itself directly grasped. RvH starts construction of conduit 3cm from pylorus

Assistant retracts the gastric fundus toward the left upper quadrant. Tip up has gastric tip length 60mm to help gauge diameter of gastric tube (5cm). RvH aims for 3cm tube

Can leave GE junction and conduit still connected OR divide completely and re-suture.  If re-suture, plan to suture in more than one place to avoid torsion. 

Suture JP2 to the GE junction to pull it into the chest cavity.

End of first staple line is tagged with Vicryl suture as a marker to guide transposition of conduit into chest. 

7. Pyloroplasty. Tip Up retracts antrum to patient left. Open longitudinally with scissors. Stay sutures. Close with interrupted 3-0 silk RB-1.  RvH does not perform pyloric drainage.

8. Feeding jejunostomy. Move camera to Port #2 (to back camera away from surgical site). May need to undock Arm #4.  Use 3-0 Stratafix RB-1 to fix jejunum to anterior abdominal wall. Run suture between abdominal wall and bowel 1/3 way around. Seldinger technique to place jejunostomy.  Continue to run 3-0 suture. Pass suture cephalad to other side. Then run cephalad to fix jejunum to anterior wall to avoid torsion. 

## Thoracic Phase

Modified prone position on a bean bag with break at the level of the tip of the scapula. Axillary roll.   Right arm is kept low at a 90 degree angle, allowing the scapula to move medially.  Slight reverse trendelenburg to keep shoulder higher than hip (to avoid collisions). Rotate patient ventrally so that posterior axillary line is highest part parallel to floor (right tilt or foam trangular wedge)

9. Dissection of Station 4R nodes.

10. Dissection of subcarinal (Station 7) nodes. Start by dissecting esophagus from trachea, then outline inferior border of right and left mainstem bronchi. Keep Station 7 lymph nodes on the specimen. 

11. Dissect 4L nodes, if desired.

12.  Dissect Station 5 nodes

13. .Completion of conduit and removal of specimen. The conduit is delivered into the thorax. This is done using a laparoscopic graster. Ensure staple line faces you (right side).  The specimen is removed through the assistant port incision. An Alexis port is used to seal the extraction site. Stomach is pulled into the chest until the **Vicryl marker suture** is seen.

14.  Division of esophagus just above level of azygous vein. ICG can be used to check perfusion. If there is any question about the length of the conduit, confirm the length of the conduit prior to division of the esophagus.


### Circular stapled anastomosis

Large needle driver to grasp anvil

**Camera moved back to Port 3 (from 2) to visualize anastomosis better **

**Port #1 may need to be remove for visibiity**

Intact minor gastric curvature of the transected specimen is brought out of the chest through the mini-thoracotomy. To insert the circular staper handle the stomach conduit is opene by incision the stapler line previusly created at the antrum in the minor curvaturell. The incision is made in the distal third of the antrum to introduce the stapler handle as far away from the gastro-esophageal crossing and allow a large distance to the greater curvature.

![](images/UGIRA52.png)

### Hand-sewn Anastomosis

Posterior running 4-0 Stratafix running posterior wall

![](images/UGIRA60a.png)


Conduit and esophagus opened anterior to staple lines, which are incorporated into the staple line. Take care to ensure incision length is the same on conduit vs esophagus.

Next the lumen of the esophagus is held up with a Cadiere Forceps by the da Vinci, while the assistant exposes the gastric tube in order to minimize the tension on the tissue . The second layer of the back wall is created by a running Stratafix Spiral® 3-0 (SH) suture placed transmural. The suture is started dorsally (9 o’clock position) and continued to ventrally (3o’clock) via the 6 o'clock position with the needle inside-out on the esophagus and outside-in on the gastric conduit. The knot is placed extraluminally.

![](images/UGIRA60b.png)

###

The anterior front wall is closed with 2 Stratafix Spiral 3-0 sutures starting one each at the dorsal and ventral edge of the remaining opening.  The first suture is started dorsally (9 o’clock) and run to the middle of the opening at 12 o’clock. The second suture is run from
ventrally 3 o´clock finishing ventral at 12 o´clock, meeting the first suture line. The securing knot is placed extraluminally.

![](images/UGIRA60c.png)

The previously mobilized mediastinal pleura is closed with either single stitches or a running suture on top of anastomosis starting at azygos stump for about 4 cm distal, and pulling in small piece of omentum for protection. This enables fixation of the gastric tube and reinforcement of the anastomosis.

### Linear Stapled Anastomosis

The esophageal stump is opened on the (right side) within the middle with cold scissors or monopolar cautery hook proximal to the transecting stapler line

The site for linear stapler insertion is measured to be at least 6 cm distal to the transecting staple line on the gastric conduit. The incision is made using monopolar cautery close to the gastroepiploic arcade

Four retraction sutures are placed (dorsal, ventral, medial and lateral) around the opened esophageal lumen, making sure to fixate the mucosa to the rest of the esophageal wall. These retraction sutures will serve for applying optimal retraction on the stump for anastomotic suturing as well as help guide the esophageal stump over the stapler anvil.

The EndoWrist stapler anvil and cartridge jaw (30 mm length) are inserted into the appropriate lumens while the console surgeon guides the tissue onto the stapler with the da Vinci instruments.
Once sufficient tissue overlap is achieved (approximately 60 mm) the stapler is fired (blue reload) and the gastric conduit and esophageal stump are connected dorsally side-to-side

34Fr gastric tube inserted.  Anterior wall closed with two 4-0 Stratafix sutures run from each side toward the middle. Overew with 4-0 PDS

Pleura and gastric tube

15.Omental flap buttress. The omental flap is positioned between the conduit and airway and the anastomosis is loosely wrapped.

#### Hand-sewn anastomosis

**Hand-sewn Anastomosis** [@ngdoaf019]
Anastomotic leakage  occurred in 11 patients (12.4%), which involved a grade I leak in four patients (4.5%), grade II leak in one patient (1.1%), and grade III leakage in six patients (6.7%).  Stricture rate was 32.6% (29 patients) at 1 year post-operatively for which dilation was needed for all patients.

**Hand-sewn vs Stapled** [@degrootdoaa055] Compared Utrecht to Sweden 2016-2019.  68 hand-sewn vs 60 stapled. Hand-sewn leak rate was 40% for cases 1-10 and 10% for cases 59-68. Overall leakage after hand-sewn in 22 patients (32%): Grade 1 =5(7%), Grade 2= 7(10%), Grade 3 10 (15%). see [@egberts1485]

Overall leakage after stapled anastomosis in 10 (17%). Stapled anastomosis leak rate 10% for cases 1-10 and 20% for cases 51-60.

**Learning Curve for Hand-sewn McKeown Esophagectomhy** [@vandersulis264]

A robot-assisted, single-layer running, **hand-sewn technique** was applied to first close the posterior wall and then the anterior wall by two separate suturing wires that were placed in identical direction to end at the same site (i.e. from 9 to 3 o’clock). If possible, the tip of the gastric conduit was removed, and an omental wrap was positioned around the anastomosis. The surgical technique was refined during the inclusion period. The first 13 cases were end-to-end (E-T-E) anastomoses. After consecutive case 13, a transit was made to an end-toside (E-T-S) anastomosis in order to be able to better tailor the level of the anastomosis at the level of the gastric tube. Furthermore, at consecutive case 18, the surgical team switched from using V-Loc 3.0 barbed suture wires (Medtronic) to Stratafix 3.0 (Ethicon) barbed suture wires. The reason for the change was that the more rigid v-lock suture could damage the esophageal wall at the level of the stiches. Starting with consecutive case 21, four supportive stitches were placed in the esophagus (i.e. at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock) before initiating the suturing. Finally, to avoid traction on the anastomosis, four tension-release stitches (i.e. at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock) were placed in the serosa of the esophagus and gastric conduit from consecutive case 47 onward. Consequently, the final anastomotic technique involved an E-T-S intrathoracic anastomosis that was created by the successive placement of four supportive stitches, single layer continuous suturing of the posterior and anterior wall with two separate Stratafix wires, four tension release stiches and an omental wrap. The incision in the gastric conduit for creating the anastomosis was made as far as possible from the longitudinal staple line and near the omentum.

**Circular stapled anastomosis**: The creation of the gastric tube is deliberately incomplete. The small gastric curvature later serves to introduce the circular stapling device in the thoracic part of the operation and is resected afterward. From our point of view, the main advantage of this method is the possibility to determine the needed length of the gastric tube in the thoracic part of the operation. The anastomosis begins with the introduction of the circular stapler anvil in the transected esophageal stump. The fixation of the anvil is secured by a pursestring suture (Stratafix 3.0). For this fixation, we use a barbed suture, which delivers a very good result especially with the robot.19 For this purpose, the bougie (24Ch) that was introduced to prevent an esophageal spasm is withdrawn. The minor curvature is now brought to the thoracic wall and incised through the assistant port. A circular stapling device with a diameter of 29 mm can now be inserted. Now, a suitable location for anastomosis can be selected near the greater curvature. Here, particular attention should be paid to the correct length of the gastric tube: the anastomosis should not be under tension, but a gastric tube that is too long can lead to emptying disorders postoperatively due to the formation of a siphon and might be not well perfused. For that reason, routinely fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green is performed to ensure adequate perfusion of the gastric tube. After selecting the appropriate location, the mandrel is extended and connected to the anvil. An assistant puts the gastric tube under slight tension and completes the anastomosis. After insertion of a bougie past the anastomosis, the minor curvature is transected with a linear stapling device, and the specimen is salvaged via the assistant port. This is followed by the circular stitch over of the anastomosis and the proximal row of the gastric staple line. It can be helpful to change the camera to arm 2, resulting in a superior overview and improved freedom of movement for the bedside surgeon.


### Stapled Anastomosis 

MIE collected series of 646 cases of Ivor Lewis esophagectomy found plateau of anastomotic leak at 8% [@vanworkum88]. Cases from from European center. his study included 646 patients. Three of the 4 hospitals reached the plateau of 8% anastomotic leakage. The length of the learning curve was 119 cases. The mean incidence of anastomotic leakage decreased from 18.8% during the learning phase to 4.5% after the plateau had been reached (P < 0.001). Thirty-six extra patients (10.1% of all patients operated on during the learning curve) experienced learning associated anastomotic leakage, that could have been avoided if patients were operated by surgeons who had completed the learning curve. The incidence of textbook outcome increased from 28% to 53% and the mean operative time decreased from 344 minutes to 270 minutes.
