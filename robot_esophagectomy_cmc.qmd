## Abdominal Position

Reverse Trendelenburg 15 degrees and 10 degree rotation to right.

**Foot plate??**

Supine on blue foam pad.

Foley catheter (with Criticor temp sensor)

Bovie pad

Lower-body Bair Hugger at level of thighs, followed by single blanket and Velcro strap

Hair clipped from abdomen, right chest, and right axilla.

Pre-existing jejunostomy

-   Prep into field
-   Remove any eschar at site
-   Secure to skin inferiorly with 0 silk

**Prep**

Patient is positioned frog-leg for prep (and is returned to supine during draping). Chloroprep (2 sticks) of abdomen and lower chest up to the level of nipples (in case urgent chest tube needed). Particular attention to prepping as far as possible to the left lateral side and the right lateral side. Prep continues inferior to base of pubis. Prep then continues into bilateral groins.

**Drape**

Groins are first draped out: Transverse 1000 drape is placed at the base of the pubis. On either side, the drape proceeds inferior and lateral to include both groins. Top gloves are changed. Legs are returned to supine position.

Blue utility (paper) drape is placed transversely just above level of pubis. While the abdominal skin incisions are being closed, ICG will be injected into groin nodes.

1000 Drapes x4 in rectangular fashion with top of field 10cm above xiphoid and bottom at base of penis. Ioban strips (4") aound the periphery of the surgical field after the trauma drape. Laparoscopic cords (gas, light cord, camera) passed off. Suction irrigator brought off field.

**Time Out**

Review:

-   Consent
-   Comorbidities, including cardiopulmonary disease
-   If patient is on home beta blockers, have they been taken?
-   Anticoagulation plan. If epidural was placed, heparin can be given as soon as 1 hour later. Circulator and anesthetist set alarms for administration.
-   Prior abdominal or thoracic operations
-   Allergies
-   Blood
    -   Surgeon’s expectation of blood loss
    -   Availability of blood (type/screen vs type/cross).
    -   Blood product administration limitations, if any (eg Jehovah's Witness)
-   Anticipated Intraop Problems:
    -   Possibility of tension left pneumothorax due to carbon dioxide entry into left chest during mediastinal dissection
    -   Expectation of ventilatory difficulties due to carbon dioxide entry into the right chest Gastric mobilization – Greater Curvature
-   Introduction by name and role
-   Co-surgeons: Confirm availability prior to incision
-   Operative plan
-   Request ICU bed in STICU

## Abdominal Phase

### Lesser Sac Dissection

Gastrohpeatic ligament divided. Celiac axis evaluated for resectability. Right crus dissected to ensure resectability. Dissection carried anteriorly and left crural dissection begun. Dissection posterior to esophagus.

Central node dissection begun, including common hepatic, left gastric, celiac, and proximal splenic aftery nodes. If replaced left hepatic artery present, may require preservation of left gastric artery. Left gastric artery divided with clips.

Posterior gastric dissection. Dissection is carried posterior towards most superior short gastric arteries (as these can be difficult to approach from the greater curvature side).

: Instruments are returned to original positions and dissection proceeds proximally, preserving the left gastroepiploic artery near its orgin. Posterior dissection from the pancreas and splenic artery is performed, followed by division of short gastric vessels

## Mediastinal dissection

Penrose drain is placed around esophagus and secured with stapler or Weck clips. Dissection proceeds to level of inferior pulmonary veins. Penrose is tucked into the mediastinum.

When Penrose is placed, confirm that heparin has been given.

## Pyloric Drainage - Pyloromyotimy (optional)

Pyloromyotomy is performed with camera in Port #2 and hook in Port #3 and Tip up in Port #4 (may need to move camera to midline)

## Pyloric Drainage - Pyloroplasty (optional)

Stay sutures of 2-0 silk are placed cephalad and caudad to pyorus. Pyloric incision is made with hook cautery. Defect is closed with 2-0 silk cut to 6" (have 2 sutures ready)

## Creation of Conduit

| 1       | 2       | 2A        | 3             | 4      |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------------|--------|

Camera is moved to Port #2. Suture cut needle driver is introduced into Port 3 and Tip Up into Port 4. Conduit is sutured to specimen with multiple sutures of 2-0 silk (cut to 6"). Arm 4 is undocked and 19 Fr Blake drain is introduced through the port. The drain is sutured to specimen with 2-0 silk cut to 4"

**JP1??**

## Preparation for Thoracic Phase

Once conduit has been constructed, confirm presence in room of bean bag, two pillows, and an extra OR bed for transition to lateral decubitus position.

## Preparation for ICG

One vial of ICG is resuspended with 10mL of water. 5mL of the solution is brought onto the sterile field in a 5mL syringe, which is fitted with a 25Ga needle. The remainder of the ICG is given to Anesthesia for later (intravenous) use.

## Jejunostomy

| 1       | 2      | 2A        | 3             | 4      |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Bipolar | Camera | Assistant | Needle Driver | Tip Up |

Camera is moved to midline (or Port 2A) and Tip up into Port 3. Camera re-oriented to 30 degrees up. Ligament of Treitz is identified and site for jejunostomy marked at 30cm with marking pen on a Prestige with 1 dot for selected site and 2 transverse marks distally. 3-0 Stratafix on RB-1 is introduced with a non-cutting needle driver into Port 3. Insufflation pressre reduced to Jejunum is sutured to abdominal wall starting at 10:00. Pursestring is run to 2:00 position and 16Ga needle from a 14Fr Cook Introducer kit passed through the abdominal wall into the bowel. Insufflation of air confirms proper position. J wire and 14FR dilator introduced and left in place. Pursestring continues around proposed site and then proceeds cephalad to provide a broader area of fixation between bowel and abdominal wall. Tract is dilated with 18Fr dilator. 14Fr MIC jejunostomy (trimmed to 10cm) is introduced through 18Fr sheath and positioned within the bowel. 5mL of water in a slip-tip (non-Luer) 10ml syringe (from the Cook introducer kit) are instilled into the jejunostomy balloon.

## Closure

Robot is disengaged and kept sterile. Laparoscopic cords are placed in a basin on a ring stand to be reused for the thoracic portion.

Abdomen is desufflated and ports removed. Port #2 site is closed by tying 0 Vicryl suture. Port sites are closed with 4-0 Monocryl followed by Dermabond.

## ICG injection into groin.

While port sites are being closed, "loincloth" is removed and hockey stick or small T ultrasound transducer is brought onto the field. Under ultrasound guidance with sterile ultrasound jelly, ICG is injected into groin nodes.

## Thoracic Phase

Patient is transferred to a spare OR table and a bean bag placed. Patient is positioned lateral with tip of scapula at break in the table. Pillows are used under and between the knees. Arm is supported on a Well Leg Holder affixed to the left headrail with a Yassargil clamp. Lateral positioners used on patient's left side to stabilize bean bag and allow tilt to the left (into modified prone position).

Lower and upper body bair hugger used. Right arm is elevated for prep and lowered once drapes in place.

## Prep and drape

Chloroprep including axilla and proximal right arm. Drape axilla/upper arm with 1000 drape.

Two blue "U" drapes used, folowed by trauma drape (or Universal). Ioban strips around edges. Once Ioban in place, arm is lowered

Laparoscopic instruments are kept sterile and may be returned to the field if pleural adhesions are encountered.

## Thoracic Ports

-   Arm #4 4th ICS 1cm medial to scapula
-   Arm #3 6th IS more medial than 4th arm and close to posterior axillary line. Camera Port.
-   Arm #2 8th ICS 12mm port for Vessel sealer or stapler
-   Arm #1 10th ICS on the scapular line or posterior on 10th ICS A1 Assitant 9th ICS triangulated beween 1 and 2. Alexis port used for extraction incision A1 Assistant

DaVinci docking with "Anatomy: Renal" "Patient Right" Target on azygous vein

## Thoracic Dissection

1.  Dissect plane between lung and anterior aspect of esophagus. Start dissection at the pericardium and proceed cephalad. Once the area of the right mainstem bronchus is approached, keep plane more superficial.

2.  Dissect onto pericardium. Confirm that tumor will comes off pericardium. Leave pulmonary vein dissection to later. Counter traction with suction.

3.  Dissection over parietal pleura up to azygous arch superficially. Dissect lower aspect of the azygous vein.

4.  Superficial dissection superior to azygous vein to reach superior extent of dissection at inferior border of sygous svein, then proceed inferiorly along the posterior aspect of the esophagus. Dissection proceeds to hiatus.

5.  Divide azygous vein with either vascular load stapler or Gray load

6.  Dissection proceeds to hiatus

7.  Divide thoracic duct with Hem-O-Lock clips at least 5cm superior to hiatus.

8.  Return to dissection plane anterior to the esophagus and deepen plane. Leave dissection of Station 7 nodes until esophagus is completely freed up. Can switch instruments in Arm 1 and Arm 2.

9.  Dissection of Station 4R nodes.

10. Dissection of subcarinal (Station 7) nodes. Start by dissecting esophagus from trachea, then outline inferior border of right and left mainstem bronchi. Keep Station 7 lymph nodes on the specimen.

## Delivery of Conduit into chest

The conduit is delivered into the thorax. This is done using a laparoscopic graster. Ensure staple line faces you (right side). The specimen is removed through the assistant port incision. An Alexis port is used to seal the extraction site. Stomach is pulled into the chest until the **Vicryl marker suture** is seen.

Division of esophagus just above level of azygous vein. ICG can be used to check perfusion. If there is any question about the length of the conduit, confirm the length of the conduit prior to division of the esophagus.

Penrose drain is recovered. Specimen is sent for frozen section with instructions to freeze proximal margin.

Once conduit is delivered into chest, set up BK ultrasound to display on robotic screen.

## Preparation of conduit

The gastric conduit is placed into the mediastinum by tucking it medially from the right pleura into the posterior mediastinum, in order to allow the conduit to take the most direct path from the hiatus to the proximal esophagus. Gentle superior tension is now applied to the conduit in order to eliminate redundancy.

## Circular stapled anastomosis - Orvil

OrVil The OrVil device is now used to place a EEA anvil into the distal esophagus. In general, a 25mm size is selected, unless the patient has particularly small frame, in which case a 21mm size is used. Two stay sutures of 2-0 silk on RB-1 needles are placed in the center of the esophageal staple line 3mm apart. A Harmonic scalpel is used to divide the staple line. The OrVil device is passed through the mouth and is passed through the fenestration in the staple line. The anvil portion of the OrVil is oriented so that the rounded portion is placed against the roof of the mouth. The OrVil is guided into the hypopharynx by pulling on the the tube end of the device. As the anvil approaches the hypopharynx, the jaw is pulled forward to allow passage of the anvil.

The shaft of the anvil is brought through the esophageal staple line, and the tube disconnected from the anvil by cutting the blue sutures.

The superior end of the conduit is opened along the staple line and the DST XL stapler (matching the diameter of the OrVil) introduced through the Alexis device (Port #2). The stapler shaft is placed into the open end of the gastric conduit and the conduit pulled over it (‘sock over shoe’). The stapler spike is brought out through the greater curvature. The anvil is grasped with a Maryland grasper placed through a superior 5mm port and the two components of the stapler are mated and the stapler tightened and fired. The knob of the stapler is rotated two turns counter-clockwise until a click is felt, at which time the anvil will flip. The stapler is withdrawn and the donuts examined and sent for pathologic exam.

The anastomosis is completed by firing a 60mm Blue load across the conduit cephalad to the anastomosis. The excess conduit is retrieved through the Alexis port and sent for pathologic exam as ‘additional gastric margin.’

## Circular stapled anastomosis - Luketich

May be helpful to move camera back to Port #3 to see anastomosis better. May need to remove Port #1 for better visibility cephalad.

Esophagus divided with robotic shears.

Pursestring suture of 0 Prolene SH to depth of 3-5mm. Two robotic arms used to stretch esophagus laterally $\rightarrow$ anvil introduced into esophagus with large needle driver $\rightarrow$ pushed superiorly $\rightarrow$ oriented cephalad-caudad. Pursestring tied. Second pursestring of 0 Prolene placed inside of first.

DST XL 28mm EEA stapler introduced through port #2 (???) into open end of conduit $\rightarrow$ mated and fired. Anastomosis completed with linear stapler. Distance between anatomosis and final linear staple line should be 2cm.

## Linear Stapled Anastomosis

The esophageal stump is opened on the (right side) within the middle with cold scissors or monopolar cautery hook just proximal to the transecting stapler line

The site for linear stapler insertion is measured to be at least 6 cm distal to the transecting staple line on the gastric conduit. The incision is made using monopolar cautery close to the gastroepiploic arcade

Four retraction sutures are placed (dorsal, ventral, medial and lateral) around the opened esophageal lumen, making sure to fixate the mucosa to the rest of the esophageal wall. These retraction sutures will serve for applying optimal retraction on the stump for anastomotic suturing as well as help guide the esophageal stump over the stapler anvil.

The robotic stapler anvil and cartridge jaw (45mm? 60mm? length) are inserted into the appropriate lumens while the console surgeon guides the tissue onto the stapler. Once sufficient tissue overlap is achieved (approximately 60 mm) the stapler is fired (blue reload) and the gastric conduit and esophageal stump are connected dorsally side-to-side

34Fr gastric tube (?or Bougie) inserted. Anterior wall closed with two 4-0 Stratafix sutures run from each side toward the middle. Second later with 4-0 PDS

### Omental Flap

Omental flap is positioned between the conduit and airway and the anastomosis is loosely wrapped.

### NG tube

NG (Salem Sump silicone 18Fr tube) is passed by anesthetist. Robotic ultrasound used to confirm location. NG tube is advanced to 4th dot just about to enter the nose.

## Drains

38Fr Chest tube (Blake or Hollow-bore) placed. 19Fr Blake (JP2) postioned posterior to anastomosis.

## Closure

Extraction site closed with 0 Vicryl. Chest tube secured with 0 silk on SH needle. Skin incisions closed with 4-0 Monocyrl and Dermabond
