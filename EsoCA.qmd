# Treatment Categories

| Category | Stage | Treatment |
|---------|:-----:|:------|
| Dysplasia | Tis | Radiofrequency Ablation|
| [Superficial](#Superficial Tumors)    | T1a   |    Endoscopic Therapy   |
| Localized    | T1b T2  |   Surgery   |
| Locally-advanced      | T3 or N^+^  |   ChemoRT &rarr; Surgery   |
| Metastatic | M1 | Chemotherapy +/- Radiation

# Dyplasia

Radiofrequency Ablation results in eradication of Barrett's in 75% at 1 year

# Superficial Tumors

Workup of nodular Barretts:

- Endoscopic Ultrasound [@butler539]
- Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
  - Diagnostic (T staging)
  - May be therapeutic for T1a tumors

# Endoscopic Musocal Resection

# Localized Cancer

Patients staged as uT2 N0 are candidates for primary surgery. *However:*

- EUS has a 25% rate of understaging uT2 N0 tumors
- Understaged patients who undergo primary surgery would need chemo or chemoRT postop

# Workup of Small Tumors (minimal dysphagia)

# Workup of Symptomatic Tumors (Dysphagia)

Patients with dysphagia to solids or weight loss or tumor length >3cm are unlikely to have T1-2 tumors and can be evaluated with [PET scan](#PET Scan):
 
 - Disease confined to the esophagus and regional nodes $\rightarrow$ [trimodality therapy](#Trimodality Therapy)
 - Metastatic disease $\rightarrow$ palliative chemotherapy
 - N3 $\rightarrow$ induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgical evaluation.

# EUS in Patients with Dysphagia

Memorial Sloan Kettering[@ripley226] patients with esophageal cancer: 

- 61 with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors. 
- 53 without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2, and were potentially candidates for primary surgery. 

EUS can be omitted from the workup of patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients without dysphagia.

# PET scan


# Trimodality Therapy

# Palliative Chemotherapy

FOLFOX is first-line systemic therapy for metastatic GI cancers

- Dose-limiting toxicity is frequently peripheral neuropathy
