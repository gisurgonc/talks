# Myosteasosis

Meta-analysis of 40 studies: overall prevalence of 48% among cancer patients, with HR of 1.75 for mortality. Worse prognosis in GYN, renal, pancreatic, HCC, GE, and Colorectal and ymphone (not lung??)[@alexio102839]

GI cancers meta-analysis: [@wang25] Prevalence of myosteatosis 46% HR 1.44. Worse prognosis for GE, pancreatic and colorectal

Lung cancer meta-analysis of 9 studies with 16667 patients: [@feng1127]. HR 1.10

myosteatosis adds value [@martin227]

Myosteatosis is defined as the infiltration of adipose tissue into skeletal muscle [@daly135]

the Charlson Comorbidity Score was associated with low SMD, echoing our previous report in this cohort that 6 (out of 11) Charlson comorbidities were associated with a higher likelihood of low SMD at diagnosis, whereas most of them were not associated with sarcopenia Xiao J, Caan BJ, Weltzien E, Cespedes Feliciano EM, Kroenke CH, Meyerhardt JA, Baracos VE, Kwan ML, Castillo AL, Prado CM.

LAMA/NAMA ratio proposed as better judge of myosteasosis than density [@kim402]
