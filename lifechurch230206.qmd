# Congregational Meeting 12/4

-   Potential capital repairs needs discussed
-   "You wouldn't put \$375K into this building, would you?"

# Congregational Meeting 12/4

\$125k in savings appeared to be allocated to several functions:

-   Balcony remodeling
-   Capital repairs
-   Rainy day emergency fund

# Analysis 1

-   Congregation would benefit from a vision for an overall facilities plan
-   Vision for the future engage congregation in giving
-   Plan would communicate that the ministry is sustainable

# Analysis 2

-   Current ministry is wholly and completely dependent upon an inhabitable building

# Proposal

1.  Develop a Growth/Sustainability plan for Life Church 2

2.  Plan should account for the vulnerability of an aging capital plant

# Assumptions

An inhabitable church building at 301 Elmhurst would be expensive (\$6M?)

Funding sources for \$6M are limited:

-   Congregational building campaign (requires increase in giving units)
-   Generous and wealthy benefactor
-   Joint venture with a developer to both maximize ROI and meet the needs of the congregation and maintain maintain church autonomy

# Proposal

Growth strategy based upon a muti-site church model:

-   Lead teaching pastor (Ben Davey)
-   Live worship team at each site
-   Site pastor at each site
-   Televised sermon

# Advantages of Multi-Site Model

-   Capitalizes on Ben's teaching gift
-   Associate/Site pastors can grow by inclusion in teaching rotation
-   Minimizes burden on site pastors for weekly sermon prep

# Tactics

Multi-site model would allow adapting the size and location of church sites to allow extrication from dependence upon an aging capital plant at 301 Elmhurst

Opportunity for growth into less expensive venues further away from South Blvd

Opportunities for growth within the region
