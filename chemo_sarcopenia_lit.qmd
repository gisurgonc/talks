# Chemotherapy and Elderly - Adjuvant

# Chemotherapy and Elderly - Stage IV

Colorectal cancer: 1013 patients with Stage IV CRC compared \<70 vs 70+. Older patients less likely to receive chemotherapy but among those that did receive chemo, improvement in survival was seen in both the older and younger groups [@chan147]

Meta-analysis of 13 trials of palliative chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer showed that chemotherapy for colorectal cancer improves survival by 3.7months and results in improvement of survival of 16% at both 6 and 12 months. ECOG 3/4 only comprise \<10% of the total sample of trial participants.[@simmonds531]

Adjuvant 5FU appears beneficial in the elderly Sargent DJ, Goldberg RM, Jacobson SD, Macdonald JS, Labianca R, Haller DG, Shepherd LE, Seitz JF, Francini G. A pooled analysis of adjuvant chemotherapy for resected colon cancer in elderly patients. N Engl J Med. 2001;345:1091--1097

# BMI and survival in stage IV cancer

Low BMI may be associated with high cancer-specific mortality (Renfro LA, Loupakis F, Adams RA. et al. Body mass index is prognostic in metastatic colorectal cancer: Pooled analysis of patients from first-line clinical trials in the ARCAD database. J Clin Oncol. 2016;34(2):144--150. 10.1200/JCO.2015.61.6441) High BMI may be an indicator of co-morbidities and may be associated with high non-cancer mortality ( Lee J, Meyerhardt JA, Giovannucci E, Jeon JY.. Association between body mass index and prognosis of colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. PLoS One. 2015;10:e0120706.) Visceral adiposity is associated with higher mortality in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy (Lee CS, Murphy DJ, McMahon C, et al. Visceral adiposity is a risk factor for poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. J Gastrointest Cancer. 2015;46(3):243--250. 10.1007/s12029-015-9709-0)

# Performance status and chemo

Clinical trials typically enroll less than 10% of patients with PS of 2

ECOG may be less accurate in the low end of the scale [@verger1328]

Low inter-observer agreement (J. Myers, K. Gardiner, K. Harris et al., "Evaluating correlation and interrater reliability for four performance scales in the palliative care setting," Journal of Pain and Symptom Management, vol. 39, no. 2, pp. 250--258, 2010.)

Poor inter-observer agreement of ECOG, with oncolgist and nurses recording higher values than patients (M. Ando, Y. Ando, Y. Hasegawa et al., "Prognostic value of performance status assessed by patients themselves, nurses, and oncologists in advanced non-small cell lung cancer," British Journal of Cancer, vol. 85, no. 11, pp. 1634--1639, 2001)

Interobserver agreement between patient and oncologist 50% in lung cancer (S. P. Blagden, S. C. Charman, L. D. Sharples, L. R. A. Magee, and D. Gilligan, "Performance status score: do patients and their oncologists agree?" British Journal of Cancer, vol. 89, no. 6, pp. 1022--1027, 2003.)

# Immunotherapy in Frail patients

Creighton: [@krishnane175] 257 patients with advanced solid tumor receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors. 182 were ECOG 0-1 and 75 were ECOG \>=2. Median overall survival was 12.6 months for the ECOG PS 0-1 group compared with 3.1 months for the ECOG PS ≥ 2 group (P \< .001). The overall response rate for patients with ECOG PS 0-1 was 23% compared with 8% for those with poor PS (P = .005). Patients with poor PS treated with ICI had similar hospice referral rates (67% for ECOG PS ≥ 2 v 61.9% for ECOG PS 0-1, P = .50) but were more likely to have in-hospital death as compared with the good PS group (28.6% v 15.1%, P = .035).

India: [@kapoore25115] 155 patients receiving ICIs. ECOG 0-1 had median survival 9.1 months vs 2.9months in ECOG 2-4. Median OS for ECOG2 was 3.7months vs 1.8 months with ECOG 3-4
