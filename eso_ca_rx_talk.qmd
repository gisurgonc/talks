|------------------|:----------:|:---------------------------|
| [Dyplasia]        |    Tis     | Radiofrequency Ablation    |
| [Superficial Tumors]      |    T1a     | Endoscopic Therapy         |
| [Localized Tumors]        |   T1b T2   | Surgery                    |
| [Locally-advanced] | T3 or N^+^ | ChemoRT â†’ Surgery          |

# Dyplasia

Radiofrequency Ablation results in eradication of Barrett's in 75% at 1 year

# Superficial Tumors

Workup of nodular Barretts:

-   Endoscopic Ultrasound 
-   Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
    -   Diagnostic (T staging)
    -   May be therapeutic for T1a tumors

# Endoscopic Musocal Resection

# Localized Tumors

Patients staged as uT2 N0 are candidates for primary surgery. *However:*

-   EUS has a 25% rate of understaging uT2 N0 tumors
-   Understaged patients who undergo primary surgery would need chemo or chemoRT postop

# Small Tumors (minimal dysphagia)

-   EUS to distinguish T2 from T3 tumors
-   If uT2 N0 $\rightarrow$ CT chest/abdomen/pelvis $\rightarrow$ Esophagectomy
-   If uT3 or N1 $\rightarrow$ PET $\rightarrow$ neoadjuvant therapy

# Symptomatic Tumors (Dysphagia)

Patients with dysphagia to solids or weight loss or tumor length \>3cm are unlikely to have T1-2 tumors and can be evaluated with [PET Scan]

-   Disease confined to the esophagus and regional nodes $\rightarrow$ [Locally-advanced]
-   Metastatic disease $\rightarrow$ [Metastatic]
-   N3 $\rightarrow$ induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgical evaluation.

# EUS in Patients with Dysphagia

Memorial Sloan Kettering[@ripley226] patients with esophageal cancer:

-   61 with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors.
-   53 without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2, and were potentially candidates for primary surgery.

EUS can be omitted for patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients *without* dysphagia.

# PET Scan

PET has more specificity and sensitivity than CT in detecting regional lymph node and distal metastasis [@block770]

# Locally-advanced

For patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer, improved outcomes with additional therapy. There are two options:

-   ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery ([CROSS Trial])
-   Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemo ([EsoPEC Trial])

# CROSS Trial

-   368 esophageal cancer patients randomized:
    -   Surgery alone
    -   Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery
-   75% adenocarcinoma
-   T3: 80%. T2: 17%
-   median age=60
-   longer survival with Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery

# CROSS - Overall Survival

![Surgery vs ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery](images/shapiro_1090_fig2a.png){fig-align="left"}

# CROSS - Survival by Histology

![Surgery vs ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery](images/shapiro_1090_fig2b.png){fig-align="left"}

# CROSS - Pathologic Complete Response

pCR seen in 23% of patients with adenocarcinoma

pCR seen in 40% of patients with squamous cell carcinoma

# Adjuvant Therapy after CROSS

Checkmate 577 Trial

Nivolumab: PD-L1 agonist ligand

Interferes with tumor cell down-regulation of T cells

Active against stage IV esophageal cancer

# Nivolumab

![Nivolumab mechanism of action](images/nivo.png)

# Chekmate 577 Trial

EsoCA patients who received ChemoRT$\rightarrow$ Surgery with residual disease (not pCR)

Randomized to one year of immunotherapy (nivolumab) vs Observation

Adjuvant nivolumab group had better survival

# Chekmate 577 Trial

# Neoadjuvant Chemo for EsoCA

- MAGIC trial (gastric): ECF$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ECF *vs* Surgery  
- OEO2 Trial: (esophageal) Chemo$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ Chemo *vs* Surgery  
- FLOT (gastric): FLOT$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ FLOT *vs* ECF$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ECF 
- EsoPEC: (esophageal):FLOT$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$FLOT *vs* ChemoRT$\rightarrow$Surgery (CROSS)


# OEO2 Clinical Trial

-   802 Esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell

-   Randomized to Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemo *vs* Surgery alone

-   Chemotherapy with ECF (Epirubicin, Cisplatin, 5FU)

-   5-year survival 23% for chemo+surgery vs 17% fo surgery (HR 0.84 p=0.03)

# EsoPEC Trial

-   Esophageal cancer

-   Randomized to CROSS vs FLOT

-   Better survival with FLOT

# Metastatic

FOLFOX is first-line systemic therapy for metastatic GI cancers

-   Dose-limiting toxicity is frequently peripheral neuropathy
