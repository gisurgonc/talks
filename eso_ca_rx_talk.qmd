## Dyplasia

Radiofrequency Ablation for Dysplasia

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
127 patients with dysplasia randomized:

-   Radio-frequency ablation
-   Sham ablation

Low-grade dysplasia in 64

High-grade dysplasia in 63

## Superficial Tumors

Workup of nodular Barretts:

-   Endoscopic Ultrasound
-   Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
    -   Diagnostic (T staging)
    -   May be therapeutic for T1a tumors

## Endoscopic Musocal Resection

![](images/EMR.jpg){fig-align="right"}

## Localized Tumors

Patients staged as uT2 N0 are candidates for primary surgery. *However:*

-   EUS has a 25% rate of understaging uT2 N0 tumors
-   Understaged patients who undergo primary surgery would need chemo or chemoRT postop

## Small Tumors (minimal dysphagia)

-   EUS to distinguish T2 from T3 tumors
-   If uT2 N0 $\rightarrow$ CT chest/abdomen/pelvis $\rightarrow$ Esophagectomy
-   If uT3 or N1 $\rightarrow$ PET $\rightarrow$ neoadjuvant therapy

Patients with dysphagia almost always are T3 tumors (and don't need EUS)

## Symptomatic Tumors (Dysphagia)

Patients with dysphagia to solids or weight loss or tumor length \>3cm are unlikely to have T1-2 tumors and can be initially evaluated with [PET Scan]

-   Disease confined to the esophagus and regional nodes $\rightarrow$ [Locally-advanced]
-   Metastatic disease $\rightarrow$ [Metastatic]
-   N3 $\rightarrow$ induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgical evaluation.

## EUS in Patients with Dysphagia

Memorial Sloan Kettering[^1] patients with esophageal cancer:

[^1]: @ripley226

-   61 with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors.
-   53 without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2 $\rightarrow$ candidates for primary surgery.

EUS can be omitted for patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients *without* dysphagia.

## PET Scan

PET has more specificity and sensitivity than CT in detecting regional lymph node and distal metastasis [^2]

[^2]: @block770

## Locally-advanced

For patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer, improved survival with adjunctive therapy. There are two options:

-   ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery ([CROSS Trial])
-   Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemo ([EsoPEC Trial])

## CROSS Trial

-   368 esophageal cancer patients randomized:
    -   Surgery alone
    -   Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery
-   75% adenocarcinoma
-   T3: 80%. T2: 17%
-   age $\tilde{x}$=60
-   longer survival with Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery

CROSS Trial Details

Chemotherapy: Weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel Radiation: 4140 cGy in 23 fractions (180cGy/fraction)

## Neoadjuvant Chemo for EsoCA

-   MAGIC trial (gastric): ECF[^3]$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ECF *vs* Surgery\
-   OEO2 Trial: (esophageal) Chemo$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ Chemo *vs* Surgery\
-   FLOT (gastric): FLOT[^4]$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ FLOT *vs* ECF$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$ECF
-   EsoPEC: (esophageal):FLOT$\rightarrow$Surgery$\rightarrow$FLOT *vs* ChemoRT$\rightarrow$Surgery (CROSS)

[^3]: Epirubicin, Cisplatin, 5FU

[^4]: 5FU, Leuvocorin, Oxaliplatin, Decetaxol

## OEO2 Clinical Trial

-   802 Esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell

-   Randomized to Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemo *vs* Surgery alone

-   Chemotherapy with ECF (Epirubicin, Cisplatin, 5FU)

## EsoPEC Trial 2
