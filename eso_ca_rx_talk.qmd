## Dyplasia

Radiofrequency Ablation for Dysplasia

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
127 patients with dysplasia randomized:

-   Radio-frequency ablation
-   Sham ablation

Low-grade dysplasia in 64

High-grade dysplasia in 63

## Superficial Tumors

Workup of nodular Barretts:

-   Endoscopic Ultrasound
-   Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
    -   Diagnostic (T staging)
    -   May be therapeutic for T1a tumors

## Endoscopic Musocal Resection

![](images/EMR.jpg){fig-align="right"}

## Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection

Endoscopic resection uses needle-knife to dissect *below* submucosa

Maybe suitable for T1b lesions *if* lesion is completely resected

Risk of perforation

## Localized Tumors

Patients staged as uT2 N0 are candidates for primary surgery. *However:*

-   EUS has a 25% rate of understaging uT2 N0 tumors
-   Understaged patients who undergo primary surgery would need chemo or chemoRT postop

## Asymptomatic Tumors (minimal dysphagia)

-   EUS to distinguish T2 from T3 tumors
-   If uT2 N0 $\rightarrow$ CT chest/abdomen/pelvis $\rightarrow$ Esophagectomy
-   If uT3 or N1 $\rightarrow$ PET $\rightarrow$ neoadjuvant therapy

Patients with dysphagia almost always are T3 tumors (and don't need EUS)

## Symptomatic Tumors (Dysphagia)

Patients with dysphagia to solids or weight loss or tumor length \>3cm are unlikely to have T1-2 tumors and can be initially evaluated with [PET Scan]

-   Disease confined to the esophagus and regional nodes $\rightarrow$ [Locally-advanced]
-   Metastatic disease $\rightarrow$ [Metastatic]
-   N3 $\rightarrow$ induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgical evaluation.

## EUS in Patients with Dysphagia

Memorial Sloan Kettering patients with esophageal cancer:

-   61 with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors.
-   53 without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2 $\rightarrow$ candidates for primary surgery.

EUS can be omitted for patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients *without* dysphagia.

## PET Scan

PET has more specificity and sensitivity than CT in detecting regional lymph node and distal metastasis

::: aside

## Locally-advanced

For patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer, improved survival with adjunctive therapy. There are two options:

-   ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery ([CROSS Trial])
-   Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemo (\[EsoPEC Trial\])

## CROSS Trial

-   368 esophageal cancer patients randomized:
    -   Surgery alone
    -   Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery
-   75% adenocarcinoma
-   T3: 80%. T2: 17%
-   age $\tilde{x}$=60
-   longer survival with Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery

CROSS Trial Details

Chemotherapy: Weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel Radiation: 4140 cGy in 23 fractions (180cGy/fraction)

## CROSS

The median time from randomization until resection was 24 days in the surgery group and 97 days in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group. Of note, 13% of patients in the surgery only group were found to be unresectable at the time of operation versus 4% of the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group (p = 0.002). R0 resection was obtained in 92% of the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 69% of the surgery alone group (p \< 0.001). There were no significant differences in complications between the two groups, including in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Positive nodes were identified in 75% of the surgery alone group versus 31% of the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group (p \< 0.001).

## Adjuvant Immunotherapy: Checkmate 577 Trial

Immunotherapy with nivolumab as adjuvant therapy after CROSS regimen for patients with residual disease

Stage II/II Esophageal or GE junction cancers Adenocarcinoma or squamous cell

ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery *with residual disease on pathology*

Treatment Group: Nivolumab every 2 weeks x 4 months $\rightarrow$ every month x 8 months

Control Group: No adjuvant therapy

Results: Better survival in group with adjuvant nivolumab

## Surgery for Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the esophagus

-   responds well to chemo+RT
-   more difficult to get a surgical margin on the airway
-   additional benefit of surgery on top of chemoRT is uncertain

## FFCD 9102 2007 (Bedenne)

All patients received 4500cGy RT + 2 cycles of cisplatin + 5FU

Patients with a clinical response were randomized:

-   Surgery -\> 2 year survival 34% Median 17.7mo

-   3 cycles of chemo + 2000 cGy RT -\> 2 year survival 40% Median 19.3mo

*No difference in overall survival*

## German Trial (Stahl)

4000 cGY RT + Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery. 64% 2-year PFS. Mortality 12.8%

6500cGy RT + Chemo: 41% 2-year PFS. Mortality 3.5%

*No difference in overall survival*
