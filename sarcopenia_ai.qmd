### AutoMATiCA

Paris Automated Muscle and Adipose Tissue Composition Analysis (AutoMATiCA) is a Python-based software that uses a neural network to automatically segment an L3-level axial CT image into the following discrete tissue types: skeletal muscle, intermuscular adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tissue, calculating both cross sectional area and density via Hounsfield units. Scans can be systematically analyzed in under a minute, greatly increasing throughput and inter-rater reliability through reliance on a single algorithm. AutoMATiCA has been shown to correlate well with manually-assessed body composition quantifications; Automated body composition analysis of clinically acquired computed tomography scans using neural networks
