# Sample Size to Study Rare Events

The hypothetical example is a study comparing two drugs with 152 participants in each arm.

The primary outcome is whether a seizure develops after traumatic brain injury.  The estimated incidence of seizure is 2%

Several hypothetical possible outcomes of the study are then arbitrarily generated.  For argument sake, the patients in the Drug A treatment arm experience 3 seizures.  Various *synthetic* data sets are then generated with between 0 and 10 seizures in the Drug B group.

# creating a data frame
```{r}
study.data <- data.frame(
    seizure = c(3, 152-3), 
    drug = c("A","B"),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
# print the data frame
print(study.data)
```
