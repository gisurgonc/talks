### Abdominal Phase

Positioning: Reverse Trendelenburg 20-25degrees and 10 degree rotation to right

Inject IC Green under ultrasound guidance into groin nodes with 25Ga needle

1.  Division of gastroesophageal and phrenoesophageal ligaments and right crural dissection. An energy device is used to divide the gastrohepatic ligament and the esophagus is dissected from the right crus. Dissection is carried anteriorly where the phrenoesophageal ligament is divided. Disssection posterior to esophagus
2.  Division of left gastric artery and vein. Common hepatic artery nodes taken with specimen. The left gastric artery and vein are dissected and surrounding lymph nodes are swept toward the stomach; they can be removed at this time or with the specimen later. The artery and vein are divided with Weck clips or a vascular cartridge stapler.
3.  Mediastinal dissection. A Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus, approximated to itself (ie with a stapler), and used for retraction to circumferentially dissect the mediastinal esophagus to the level of the inferior pulmonary veins. The Penrose is tucked into the mediastinum.
4.  Preparation of right gastroepiploic pedicle. The right gastroepiploic artery and vein are identified, the lesser sac is entered, and a healthy pedicle of right gastroepiploic adipose is created. Dissection continues towards the pylorus and then cranially along the stomach's greater curvature.
5.  Creation of pedicled omental flap and division of short gastric arteries and veins. A pedicled omental flap is designed based on right gastroepiploic and short gastric arterial inflow, and the highest short gastric vessels are divided.
6.  Creation of gastric conduit. The lesser curvature adipose is divided between the caudal 2 branches of the right gastric artery and a 4-cm wide conduit is created with serial applications of green staple cartridges. The conduit is never itself directly grasped.

Assistant retracts the gastric fundus toward the left upper quadrant. Tip up has gastric tip length 60mm to help gauge diameter of gastric tube (5cm).

Can leave GE junction and conduit still connected OR divide completely and re-suture.

Suture JP2 to the GE junction to pull it into the chest cavity.

End of first staple line is tagged with Vicryl suture as a marker to guide transposition of conduit into chest. 7. Pyloroplasty. Tip Up retracts antrum to patient left. Open longitudinally with scissors. Stay sutures. Close with interrupted 3-0 silk RB-1 8. Feeding jejunostomy

## Thoracic Phase

Modified prone position. Slight reverse trendelenburg to keep shoulder higher than hip (to avoid collisions). Rotate patient ventrally so that posterior axillary line is highest part parallel to floor (right tilt or foam trangular wedge)

1.  Divide azygous vein (stapler or Weck clips)
2.  Dissect esophagus circumferentially
3.  Division of inferior pulmonary ligament and station 9 nodal dissection. The inferior pulmonary ligament is divided and station 9 lymph nodes are removed. 4.Entry into mediastinum, dissection of distal esophagus, station 8 nodal dissection. The mediastinum is entered and the Penrose drain is retrieved and used for retraction to dissect the distal esophagus. Station 8 lymph does are removed and/or dissected in such a way that they are removed with the specimen.
4.  Dissection of mid-esophagus and station 7/8/10 lymph nodes. The mid-esophagus is dissected from the airway with precise application of energy. Station 7, 8, and 10 lymph nodes are removed.
5.  Division of azygous vein, dissection of upper esophagus, station 2/4 nodal dissection. The azygous vein is divided with a vascular stapler cartridge and the upper esophagus is dissected. A paratracheal nodal dissection is completed. 7.Completion of conduit and removal of specimen. The conduit is delivered into the thorax and it is separated from the specimen with green staple cartridges. This is done using a laparoscopic graster. Stomach is pulled into the chest until the Vicryl marker suture is seen. The specimen is removed through the assistant port incision. An Alexis port is used to seal the extractio site.
6.  Division of esophagus just above level of azygous vein. ICG can be used to check perfusion.

14.Anastomosis. The staple line of the upper thoracic esophagus is removed sharply, the geometry of the anastomosis is planned, and a small gastrotomy is made on the conduit. A green cartridge unites the esophagus and conduit and the common enterotomy is closed, here using two running layers. 15.Omental flap buttress. The omental flap is positioned between the conduit and airway and the anastomosis is loosely wrapped.
