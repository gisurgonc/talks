## Staging

Node positive patients are staged with "PET/CT Whole Body." This is different from PET used for staging GI cancers, which is "PET/CT Skull Base to Mid Thigh"

High risk patients will need either MRI or CT of brain

## MSLT-I Clinical trial

[@morton599]

## MSLT-II

Patients with positive sentinel nodes were randomized to completion lymph node dissection vs observation (with periodic ultrasound of the draining node basin)

No difference in overall survival

Patients with dysphagia almost always are T3 tumors (and don't need EUS)

## Symptomatic Tumors (Dysphagia)

Patients with dysphagia to solids or weight loss or tumor length \>3cm are unlikely to have T1-2 tumors and can be initially evaluated with \[PET Scan\]

-   Disease confined to the esophagus and regional nodes $\rightarrow$ [Locally-advanced]
-   Metastatic disease $\rightarrow$ [Metastatic]
-   N3 $\rightarrow$ induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation and surgical evaluation.

## ACOSOG ZZ9001

GIST Tumors \>3cm randomized: - 1 year of imatinib 40mg - Observation

## Mutational Testing

Genetic mutations can predict respoinse to imatinib [^1]

## Locally-advanced

For patients with locally-advanced esophageal cancer, improved survival with adjunctive therapy. There are two options:

-   ChemoRT $\rightarrow$ Surgery (\[CROSS Trial\])
-   Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemo ([EsoPEC Trial])

## Positive Margins

-   368 esophageal cancer patients randomized:
    -   Surgery alone
    -   Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery
-   75% adenocarcinoma
-   T3: 80%. T2: 17%
-   median age=60
-   longer survival with Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery

## OEO2 Clinical Trial

-   802 Esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell

-   Randomized to Chemo $\rightarrow$ Surgery $\rightarrow$ Chemo *vs* Surgery alone

## EsoPEC Trial

## Metastatic

FOLFOX is first-line systemic therapy for metastatic GI cancers

-   Dose-limiting toxicity is frequently peripheral neuropathy
