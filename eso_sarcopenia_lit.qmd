## Sarcopenia in esophageal cancer

The patient with esophageal cancer faces multiple challenges in changes in body composition related to both muscle mass and adipose tissue. Patients frequently present with loss of adipose tissue and muscle from dysphaghia due to the primary tumor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation can improve oral intake due to tumor shrinkage, but can also decrease oral nutrition due to esophagitis and the catabolic effects of cytotoxic therapy.  In addition, patients undergoing esophagectomy frequently lose weight due to limited oral intake and the catabolic effects of the stress of surgery.

For patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy, the chemoradiation treatment prior to surgery can be seen as a 'stress test' which can further assist in evaluating a patient's resilience to the stress of surgery.

The coexistence of sarcopenia and obesity has led to the identification of a syndrome of sarcopenia obesity, defined as sarcopenia in the context of a BMI \>30kg/m\^2. These patients suffer the consequences of both loss of muscle mass with excess adipose tissue, which appear to act synergistically to decrease survival in cancer patients.{prado, 629; martin}

## Skeletal muscle loss in esophagectomy patients

A Japanese group of 190 patients undergoing esophagectomy were studied. Sarcopenia was found in 149 (75%)[@nishigori678] Among sarcopenic patients, pneumonia occurred in 44 (29%) vs 5 (10%) among patients without sarcopenia. Another group [@ida4432]found similar association between sarcopenia and pulmonary complications after esophagectomy.

A Japanese study examined the predictive value of sarcopenia relative to anastomotic after esophagectomy[@tamandl1359]. While sarcopenia in patients under age 65 was not associated with adverse outcomes, among 166 patients over age 65, sarcopenia was associated with increased risk of anastomotic leak and in-hospital mortality.

Among 98 Japanese patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, 31 (31%) were found to be sarcopenic. Among these patients the 90-day readmission rate was 42.9% vs 16% in those without sarcopenia[@makiura456]. In addition, sarcopenia was associated with overall survival after adjusting for age, gender, and pathologic stage.

A small group of patients (n=35) with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation showed an increase in the percentage rated as sarcopenic as a result of chemoradiation {Yip, 2014 #2001}. Investigators in the UK noted similar changes in muscle mass among 14 patients as a result of neoadjuvant chemotherapy{Awad, 2012 #1990}. Neither study showed differences between loss of muscle mass and length of stay or survival, although neither study included a power analysis of these outcomes. A larger study from the Netherlands (n=123) {Reisinger, 2015 #1993} showed no association between muscle mass loss in mortality in the overall group, but did find a significant difference in mortality in 62 patients with stage III or IV disease.

Among 123 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation,the loss of muscle mass during chemoradiation (as measured by skeletal muscle CSA) was predictive of postoperative mortality {Reisinger, #1993}. Muscle loss was 13.5% in patients with complication-related mortality, and 8% in those without.

## Skeletal muscle loss and survival after esophagectomy

Among 130 Austrian patients, sarcopenia was noted in 80 (62%). Median survival was longer in patients without sarcopenia (52months) compared with those with sarcopenia (21 months).{Paireder, 2017 #2003}

Among 131 Korean patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, psoas muscle area was associated with survival.{Park, 2017,13}  Among patients with higher psoas muscle area, 3-year survival was 64.9% and 37% in patients with lower psoas muscle area.

A Japanese study examined the predictive value of sarcopenia relative to anastomotic leak and overall survival after esophagectomy {Tamandl, 2016 #2006}. While sarcopenia in patients under age 65 was not associated with adverse outcomes, among 166 patients over age 65, sarcopenia was associated with decreased overall survival.

Among 98 Japanese patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, 31 (31%) were found to be sarcopenic. Among these patients.{Makiura, 2018 #2007} sarcopenia was associated with overall survival after adjusting for age, gender, and pathologic stage.

A meta-analysis of 4 studies totaling 649 patients showed that sarcopenia was associated with a survival hazard ratio of 1.5 compared with non-sarcopenia patients {Shachar, 2017 #2122}.

Patients undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy showed that among 230 patients, psoas muscle area was associated with post-operative survival among 64 patient who did not undergo neoadjuvant therapy, but was not a significant predictor on multivariable analysis among patients who received neoadjuvant therapy.{Sheetz, 2013 #1999}

Meta-analysis of 11 studies found that sarcopenia was associated with decreased survival after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer [@dengdoy115]
