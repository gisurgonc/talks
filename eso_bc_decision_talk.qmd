## Esophagectomy for Esophageal Cancer

Despite advanced in minimally-invasive techniques, esophagectomy carries a risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality, particularly in frail patients.

Accurate risk prediction is critical in surgical decision-making, particularly in patients with locally-advanced cancers treated initially with chemoradiation

## Body Composition Analysis from CT scan images

Muscle mass and quality can be measured from staging CT scans and have been shown to accurately predict surgical outcomes

## Methods

- 399 Minimally-invasive esophagectomy
- Skeletal Muscle Gauge: abdominal wall muscle area × muscle density from CT
- “Low Muscle”: Bottom quartile SMG
- Age categorized as <75 vs 75+
- Operative mortality at 90 days compared based upon age and skeletal muscle

## Conclusions

CT-derived muscle measurements accurately risk-stratify patients undergoing minimally-invasive esophagectomy:
\
Normal Muscle and Age <75:      

- 1.8% mortality (n=281)
\
Low Muscle and Age 75+:      3

- 032% mortality (n=28)
