Cervical anastomosis has 5x higher leak rate than thoracic.

Aortic calcifications and risk of leak [@goense247]

## Circular Stapled Anastomosis

Mainz 28mm Circular Stapler - leak rate 12-14% [@froiiodoac044]

Utrecht - No differnce 28 vs 25 [@tagkalos2242]

## Linear Stapled Anastomosis

Kukar, Ben-Kafir,

Italy Fabbi [@fabbi2681]. 256 patients were included; of those, 220 received the anastomosis with a circular stapler (CS group), and 36 received the anastomosis with a linear stapler (LS group). The rate of anastomotic leakage did not differ in the two groups (9.6% CS vs. 5.6% LS, p = 0.438), as well as the rate of anastomotic stricture in the 3-month follow-up (0.9% CS vs. 2.8% LS, p = 0.367).
