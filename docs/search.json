Gastrostomy placement, particularly via the endoscopic approach (PEG) runs the risk of damage to the right gastroepiploic vascular arcade, which might devascularize a future gastric conduit, although small series suggest that this risk is low (Margolis et al. 2003)\nAnecdotal data suggests that esophagectommy with gastric conduit can safely be performed after gastrostomy, particularly if placement is done via laparoscopy and if the tube can be removed prior to esophagectomy to allow the tract to heal.

Improvement seen in six-minute walk test, but no difference in complications or operative mortality.\non the return of functional activity after a major surgical procedure. Hence, efforts to optimize functional capacity prior to surgery have shown improved outcomes for some abdominal and oncologic surgeries [20]. A multimodal approach termed as ‘prehabilitation’ comprising nutritional supplementation, psychological counselling, medical optimization, and a structured exercise program involving both aerobic and strengthening activity has been proposed to improve outcomes [21]. Respiratory optimization with deep breathing exercises, spirometry, and inspiratory muscle training decreases pulmonary complications [22]. Studies have shown that prehabilitation reduces anxiety, depression and fatigue, and improves the quality of life [23]. Preliminary results from a recently concluded study [24] on prehabilitation for esophageal surgery demonstrated improvement in functional capacity; however, the impact on postoperative outcomes needs to be evaluated by further ongoing studies [25]. Extrapolation from studies on other abdominal surgeries [20] suggests that at least 4 weeks of preoperative prehabilitation is better than postoperative rehabilitation to influence outcomes. As most patients with operable esophageal cancer would receive neoadjuvant treatment, it would be opportunistic to use this preoperative window to initiate prehabilitation.\nA feasibility trial of prehabilitation before oesophagogastric cancer surgery using a multi-component home-based exercise programme: the ChemoFit study.(Chmelo et al. 2022)\nThe Role of Prehabilitation in Modern Esophagogastric Cancer Surgery: A Comprehensive Review.(Bausys et al. 2022)\nPrehab (Gillis et al. 2018)"

Longer survival in trimodality group (77 vs 33 months). For those with a complete clinical response, trimodality resulted in 123 moths survival vs 55 months with dCRT.

In the input pipeline, the ground truth image was extracted from the Mimics-exportedDigital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) using a simple R [69] procedure, with the oro.nifti [70] library providing input and output functionality. The mask was cleaned using a custom Python script built with NiBabel [71] for I/O, SciPy [72] for spatial calculations, and NumPy [73] for general numeric operations. Additional preparation of ground truth data used the ImageMath and fslstats programs of the Advanced Normalization Tools [74] and FMRIB Software Library [75] respectively. Preparation of the 3-channel input images used scikit-image’s [76] rescale_intensity and equalize_adapthist functions for clipping and equalization. Overlap measures were implemented as functions of the confusion matrix provided by scikit-learn’s [77] confusion_matrix function and assembled into easily-analyzed tabular representations using Pandas [78].

Manual segmentation with Mimics.\nIn the input pipeline, the ground truth image was extracted from the Mimics-exportedDigital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) using a simple R [69] procedure, with the oro.nifti [70] library providing input and output functionality. The mask was cleaned using a custom Python script built with NiBabel [71] for I/O, SciPy [72] for spatial calculations, and NumPy [73] for general numeric operations. Additional preparation of ground truth data used the ImageMath and fslstats programs of the Advanced Normalization Tools [74] and FMRIB Software Library [75] respectively.\nPreparation of the 3-channel input images used scikit-image’s [76] rescale_intensity and equalize_adapthist functions for clipping and equalization. Overlap measures were implemented as functions of the confusion matrix provided by scikit-learn’s [77] confusion_matrix function and assembled into easily-analyzed tabular representations using Pandas [78]. Subsequent correlation analyses of the muscle CSA and MA were performed with R’s cor.test function. Algorithm can’t select L3 [Working with DICOM and IIfTI in R](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v44/i06/.)
