    "text": "Cancer cachexia is characterized by significant weight loss and muscle wasting. It is often accompanied by weakness, fatigue, and a loss of appetite. Cancer cachexia is a complex and multifactorial syndrome that is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including the cancer itself, the cancer treatment, and the body’s response to the cancer. Cancer cachexia can have a significant impact on a person’s quality of life and is associated with a poor prognosis.\nInternational consensus (Fearon et al. 2011) defined cancer cachexia as being characterized by a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass,with or without loss of adipose mass. This cachexia cannotbe fully supported by conventional nutritional support and gradually leads to functional impairment. It has been described as a continuum with three stages of diagnosis: pre‐cachexia, cachexia, and refractory cachexia.\nFearon: Three-factor model with weight loss >10%, low food intake (<1500kcal/day) and systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein >10mg/l) (fearon?). All three factors required.\nValidation of cachexia definition: (Blum et al. 2014). Proposed a four-group classification model, which required use of CRP. PS-SGA and Edmonton Symptom Assessment System. Four group classification did not distinguish better than two group.\nReview: Cachexia and sarcopenia (Dolly, Dumas, and Servais 2020)\nCachexia Score (CASCO): body weight and lean body mass loss; anorexia; infmallation, immunologic and metabolic disturbances; physical performance and quality of life\n\n\n\nThe cancer itself: Some types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer, are more likely to cause cachexia than others. The presence of certain types of cancer cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages, may also contribute to the development of cachexia.\nThe body’s response to the cancer: The body’s immune system may produce certain hormones and cytokines in response to the cancer, which can lead to inflammation and weight loss.\nCancer treatment: Some cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can cause side effects that lead to weight loss and muscle wasting.\nNutritional factors: People with cancer may have difficulty getting enough nutrients due to a lack of appetite, difficulty swallowing, or other factors.\nPsychological factors: Depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions that are common in people with cancer may contribute to weight loss and muscle wasting, particularly through inactivity"

CT scan at L3 was analyed to determine SMI,IMAT,VAT,SAT and TAT (=VAT+SAT+IMAT) using SliceOMatic. Threshold values determined for optimal stratification (cf {Martin et al. (2013);(prado639?)})\nLow muscle mass has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis cancer patients.(Martin et al. 2013) This may be due to overal frailty or low muscle mass may lead to increased toxicity from chemotherapy due to pharmacokinetic mechanism. 5-FU is hydrophilic and it volume of distribution includes the muscle compartment, while oxaliplatin is hydrophobic, with distribution in the fat compartment(Bozzetti 2017).\nIn addition, loss of muscle mass during chemotherapy for advanced cancers is a poor prognosticator.\nBlauhoff (Blauwhoff-Buskermolen et al. 2016) studis 67 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Muscle area on CT decreased by 6.1% over 3 months. Patients in the lowest tertile (loss of 9%) had worse survial. Overall survival 17.5 months for first-line chemotherapy and 8.5months for second-line. Baseline muscle density was predictive of survival on multivariable analysis, but low SMI at baseline was not associatesd with survival. (This may be because sarcopenic obesity is the major risk factor, and there were few obese patients in the study cohort) >Muscle loss of 9% or more remained independently associated with survival when adjusted for sex, age, baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, comorbidity, mono-organ or multiorgan metastases, treatment line, and tumor progression at first evaluation by computed tomography scan (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.21 to 9.05; P , .001). We found a mean coefficient of variation between observers of 0.6% for skeletal muscle area in a random sample of 20 patients, which is regarded to be low.(MacDonald, Greig, and Baracos 2011). Changes between the first and second scans were calculated as a rate of change per 3 months, meaning change per first evaluation, to compare with available literature.[awad74][prado1583]Relative muscle change per 3 months was categorized into tertiles of muscle change: tertile one, highest muscle loss up to 9%; tertile two, muscle loss of 9% to 1.5%; and tertile three, muscle loss of 1.5% until highest gain in muscle. However, the survival curve of tertile two was not significantly different from the survival curve of tertile three (log-rank P = .961); therefore tertiles two and three were pooled (cutoff, 9% muscle loss).\nKurk (Kurk et al. 2020) found that skeletal muscle loss during chemotherapy was associated with decreased progression-free and overall- survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nDetailed changes in skeletal muscle mass and body weight during CAIRO3 treatments were previously reported.KurkS, p909, 2018) We additionally analyzed changes in SMI and BMI during these treatments by linear mixed effects models.(Bayar MA,p311,2017) The baseline value of the outcome (SMI/BMI) was included in the outcome vector. Potential confounders were age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, best response to initial six cycles CAPOX‐B, resection of the primary tumor, and the number of metastatic sites. The final model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and included: treatment arm, time, age, sex, resection primary tumor, and the interaction of treatment arm by time as fixed effects. Modeling time as a random effect did not increase the model fit as indicated by the AIC. To investigate differences in SMI and BMI changes over time between the CAIRO3 treatment arms, we checked the significance of the two‐way interaction including treatment arm by time.\n\n\nDuring p2 (maintenance CAP‐B/observation), again absolute SMI and BMI at the start (t1) of treatment were not associated with early progression and death. In contrast, SMI loss and BMI loss during treatment were associated with early progression and death.\n\nFogelman (Fogelman et al. 2014) treated patients undergoing chemotherapy with a novel agent designed to reduce muscle less. CT scans at 2 months were compared with baseline scans prior to chemotherapy.\n\nChanges in skeletal muscle were determined using routinely acquired CT scans for patients on the study. We calculated skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). A single slice at the mid-point of L3 was used, preferably a 2.5-mm slice if available, and a 5-mm slice if a 2.5-mm slice was not available. The L3 is a landmark that has been extensively used and validated in studies assessing body composition in cancer patients [Shen et al. (2004)](C. M. M. Prado, Birdsell, and Baracos 2009) . Skeletal muscle surface areas were determined using Slice-o-Matic softwareTM, version 4.3 (Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada) using pre-established thresholds of Hounsfield units (HU) of −29 to +150 (Mitsiopoulos et al. 1998). We additionally evaluated adipose tissue cross-sectional area (subcutaneous, visceral, and intramuscular) in the L3 region as described previously (Mourtzakis et al. 2008). Changes in muscle and adipose tissue surface areas over time were determined for each patient from the baseline study to the first CT post treatment, done after 2 months. We looked at muscle loss as a continuous variable and defined “meaningful loss” as greater than a 6 cm2 difference from the baseline to the second scan. We chose this cut point as it is equivalent to 1 kg of skeletal muscle and is associated with physical function (i.e., muscle strength). Additionally, this cut point has been used to investigate significant changes in muscle mass throughout cancer disease trajectory [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al. 1988)(C. M. Prado et al. 2013).\n\nPrado (C. M. Prado et al. 2013) looked at changes in 1279 CT scans in 368 patients with advanced cancer. The last available interval with CT scans was chosen for comparison. Categorized into stable, gaining, losing for muscle and for adipose tissue. Adipose tissue was ?? sum of visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous tissue. (Did not use SMI). Muscel loss and adipose loss seemed correlated, with larger magnitude of adipose tissue loss at short interval to death. (Authors conclusion that muscle and adipose tissue loss in the past 3 months of life is likely not possible) >Advanced-cancer patients (n = 368; median survival: 196 d) had a total of 1279 CT images over the course of their disease. With consideration of all time points, muscle loss occurred in 39% of intervals between any 2 scans. However, the overall frequency of muscle gain was 15.4%, and muscle was stable in 45.6% of intervals between any 2 scans, which made the maintenance or gain of muscle the predominant behavior. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that being within 90 d (compared with >90 d) from death was the principal risk factor for muscle loss (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.94; P = 0.002), and muscle gain was correspondingly less likely (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.69; P = 0.002) at this time. Sex, age, BMI, and tumor group were not significant predictors of muscle loss or gain. A much higher proportion of men (61%) than women (31%) met the criteria for sarcopenia. Changes in muscle and adipose tissue over time were calculated as the absolute loss or gain of tissue area during each scan interval. The precision error of measurements was ~1.5% (Mourtzakis et al. 2008) with a minimum detectable change of ~3 cm2. We attributed the change during each interval into the following categories: 1) muscle loss ≥6.0 cm2, 2) stable muscle ±5.9 cm2, or 3) muscle gain ≥6.0cm2. These cutoffs are equivalent to a loss or gain of ≥1 kg of skeletal muscle on a whole-body basis and are associated with alterations in muscle strength [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al. 1988). For adipose tissue, categories were based on the equivalence of 14.7 cm2 total fat at L3 and 1 kg tissue on a whole-body basis (Shen et al. 2004); therefore, changes during each interval were categorized as 1) adipose tissue loss ≥14.7 cm2, 2) stable adipose tissue ±14.6 cm2, or 3) adipose tissue gain ≥14.7 cm2. CT scans were taken for the diagnosis, confirmation of stage, and follow-up of disease progression and treatment. With the understanding that cachexia evolves markedly in the end of life and to take advantage of repeated measures, we focused on patients with ≥2 CT images (2–6 images) on record during the year preceding their deaths (n = 368). A selection bias was not apparent in this sample; we showed that the sex distribution, age at death, survival time, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, and body-composition features (ie, muscle and adipose tissues) in patients who had only a single scan were not different from those of the overall cohort at an equal time to death (P > 0.1). Patients included in the analysis (n = 368) were of advanced stage, and the median time to death of all groups was <1 y.\nLieffers and advanced colorectal cancer: Found liver and spleen increased in size in terminal patients (causing increase in basal metabolic rate). Found more rapid muscle loss with progressive disease (Jessica R. Lieffers et al. 2009). Different thresholds for VAT (-150 to -50) and SAT(-190 to -30). Also estimated muscel surface area using measurements 5cm above L4(Shen et al. 2004). Most rapid change in body composition between 4 months and 1 month prior to death. >14% of patients gained skeletal muscle during the year preceding death from colorectal cancer (+4.7 ± 5.4%/100 d).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{(feliciano?) e172319} PMID 28796857PMID 24122750PMID 24866483"

The early recovery group had fewer pulmonary complications (17% vs 33%) and fewer overall complications (33% vs 52%). No difference in anastomotic leakage (12% vs 16%). No difference in length of stay or pain scores(Shen et al. 2022).\nMeta-analysis (Pisarska et al. 2017), included 2042 patients (1058 in an ERAS group vs 984 in a traditional group), revealed a significantly shorter hospital stay and fewer non-surgical and pulmonary complications in the ERAS group, but no effect on overall morbidity, mortality or readmission rates.\nMeta-analysis of 13 reports of enhanced recovery protocols performed a regression analysis to identify factors which may be important in length of stay reductions. These factors included immediate extubation, early gastrograffin study, early urinary catheter removal, early feeding with at least sips of water on the first postoperative day, early enteral feeding, and epidural catheter removal within 4 days(Markar et al. 2017).\nVirginia Mason ERAS (Schmidt et al. 2016)\n\n\n\nPatients with esophageal cancer frequently suffer from undernutrition due to GI tract obstruction and the pro-inflammatory effects of cancer and the effects of neoadjuvant therapy.

Gastrostomy placement, particularly via the endoscopic approach (PEG) runs the risk of damage to the right gastroepiploic vascular arcade, which might devascularize a future gastric conduit(Ohnmacht et al. 2006), although small series suggest that this risk is low (Margolis et al. 2003).\nA meta-analysis of over 1000 patients treated with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy prior to esophagectomy found no differences in anastomtic leak rate and no instances of conduit failure due to PEG placement (Fang et al. 2022)\nAnecdotal data suggests that esophagectommy with gastric conduit can safely be performed after gastrostomy, particularly if placement is done via laparoscopy and if the tube can be removed prior to esophagectomy to allow the tract to heal.

Hence, efforts to optimize functional capacity prior to surgery have shown improved outcomes for some abdominal and oncologic surgeries [20]. A multimodal approach termed as ‘prehabilitation’ comprising nutritional supplementation, psychological counselling, medical optimization, and a structured exercise program involving both aerobic and strengthening activity has been proposed to improve outcomes [21]. Respiratory optimization with deep breathing exercises, spirometry, and inspiratory muscle training decreases pulmonary complications [22]. Studies have shown that prehabilitation reduces anxiety, depression and fatigue, and improves the quality of life [23]. Preliminary results from a recently concluded study [24] on prehabilitation for esophageal surgery demonstrated improvement in functional capacity; however, the impact on postoperative outcomes needs to be evaluated by further ongoing studies [25]. Extrapolation from studies on other abdominal surgeries [20] suggests that at least 4 weeks of preoperative prehabilitation is better than postoperative rehabilitation to influence outcomes. As most patients with operable esophageal cancer would receive neoadjuvant treatment, it would be opportunistic to use this preoperative window to initiate prehabilitation.\nA feasibility trial of prehabilitation before oesophagogastric cancer surgery using a multi-component home-based exercise programme: the ChemoFit study.(Chmelo et al. 2022)\nThe Role of Prehabilitation in Modern Esophagogastric Cancer Surgery: A Comprehensive Review.(Bausys et al. 2022)\nPrehab (Gillis et al. 2018)"

    "text": "Sarcopenia Methods Sarcopenia in GI Cancers Sarcopenia in Chemotherapy Esophageal Cancer Therapy\nThe patient with esophageal cancer faces multiple challenges in changes in body composition related to both muscle mass and adipose tissue. Patients frequently present with loss of adipose tissue and muscle from dysphaghia due to the primary tumor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation can improve oral intake due to tumor shrinkage, but can also decrease oral nutrition due to esophagitis and the catabolic effects of cytotoxic therapy.  In addition, patients undergoing esophagectomy frequently lose weight due to limited oral intake and the catabolic effects of the stress of surgery.\nFor patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy, the chemoradiation treatment prior to surgery can be seen as a ‘stress test’ which can further assist in evaluating a patient’s resilience to the stress of surgery.\nThe coexistence of sarcopenia and obesity has led to the identification of a syndrome of sarcopenia obesity, defined as sarcopenia in the context of a BMI >30kg/m^2. These patients suffer the consequences of both loss of muscle mass with excess adipose tissue, which appear to act synergistically to decrease survival in cancer patients.(prado629?) (martin?)\n\n\nA Japanese group of 190 patients undergoing esophagectomy were studied. Sarcopenia was found in 149 (75%).[(nishigori?)]{Nishigori, 2016 #1996} Among sarcopenic patients, pneumonia occurred in 44 (29%) vs 5 (10%) among patients without sarcopenia. Another group(Ida?) {Ida, 2015 #1995} found similar association between sarcopenia and pulmonary complications after esophagectomy.\nA Japanese study examined the predictive value of sarcopenia relative to anastomotic after esophagectomy(Tamandl et al. 2016). While sarcopenia in patients under age 65 was not associated with adverse outcomes, among 166 patients over age 65, sarcopenia was associated with increased risk of anastomotic leak and in-hospital mortality.\nAmong 98 Japanese patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, 31 (31%) were found to be sarcopenic. Among these patients the 90-day readmission rate was 42.9% vs 16% in those without sarcopenia(makiura456?). In addition, sarcopenia was associated with overall survival after adjusting for age, gender, and pathologic stage.\nIrish study (Elliott et al. 2017)\n\n\n\nNottingham: 89 patients with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Sarcopenia associated with dose-limiting toxiciy and shortened survival after esopahgectomy (Tan et al. 2015)\n72 pts getting neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Sarcopenic obesity associated with dose-limiting toxicity.(anandavadivelan724?)\n47 patients getting neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Chemotherapy increased rate of sarcopenia. (Awad et al. 2012)\nA small group of patients (n=35) with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation showed an increase in the percentage rated as sarcopenic as a result of chemoradiation {Yip, 2014 #2001}. Investigators in the UK noted similar changes in muscle mass among 14 patients as a result of neoadjuvant chemotherapy{Awad, 2012 #1990}. Neither study showed differences between loss of muscle mass and length of stay or survival, although neither study included a power analysis of these outcomes. A larger study from the Netherlands (n=123) {Reisinger, 2015 #1993} showed no association between muscle mass loss in mortality in the overall group, but did find a significant difference in mortality in 62 patients with stage III or IV disease.\nAmong 123 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation,the loss of muscle mass during chemoradiation (as measured by skeletal muscle CSA) was predictive of postoperative mortality {Reisinger, #1993}. Muscle loss was 13.5% in patients with complication-related mortality, and 8% in those without.\nMiyata H, Sugimura K, Motoori M, Fujiwara Y, Omori T, Yanagimoto Y, Ohue M, Yasui M, Miyoshi N, Tomokuni A, et al. Clinical assessment of sarcopenia and changes in body composition during neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer (Miyata et al. 2017)\n\n\n\nDaly LE, Ni Bhuachalla EB, Power DG, Cushen SJ, James K, Ryan AM.

Median survival was longer in patients without sarcopenia (52months) compared with those with sarcopenia (21 months).{Paireder, 2017 #2003}\nAmong 131 Korean patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, psoas muscle area was associated with survival.{Park, 2017,13}  Among patients with higher psoas muscle area, 3-year survival was 64.9% and 37% in patients with lower psoas muscle area.\nA Japanese study examined the predictive value of sarcopenia relative to anastomotic leak and overall survival after esophagectomy {Tamandl, 2016 #2006}. While sarcopenia in patients under age 65 was not associated with adverse outcomes, among 166 patients over age 65, sarcopenia was associated with decreased overall survival.\nAmong 98 Japanese patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, 31 (31%) were found to be sarcopenic. Among these patients.{Makiura, 2018 #2007} sarcopenia was associated with overall survival after adjusting for age, gender, and pathologic stage.\nA meta-analysis of 4 studies totaling 649 patients showed that sarcopenia was associated with a survival hazard ratio of 1.5 compared with non-sarcopenia patients {Shachar, 2017 #2122}.\nPatients undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy showed that among 230 patients, psoas muscle area was associated with post-operative survival among 64 patient who did not undergo neoadjuvant therapy, but was not a significant predictor on multivariable analysis among patients who received neoadjuvant therapy.{Sheetz, 2013 #1999}\nMeta-analysis of 11 studies found that sarcopenia was associated with decreased survival after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer (Deng et al. 2019)\nSarcopenia and survival and unplanned admissions after esophagectomy (makiura456?)\nSarcopenia and postop pulmonary complications after esophagectomy (makiura430?)"

The CARE survey measures activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs (iADLs), the ability to walk 1 block, the number of falls within 6 months, nutrition, comorbid conditions, cognitive complaints, anxiety, depression, social support, social activities, and self-rated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status. Domain-specific cutoffs were used in accordance with prior literature.21, 23-25 Frailty was reported using the CARE Frailty Index based on the principles of deficit accumulation, as previously published.26, 27 In brief, the CARE Frailty Index includes 44 geriatric assessment variables identified as health deficits from the CARE survey, each of which is scored as 0 (no deficit) or 1 (deficit present) (see Supporting Methods). These values were then combined and divided by the overall number of deficits assessed (range, 0-1) and categorized as robust (0-0.2), prefrail (0.2-0.35), and frail (>0.35).26 In addition, the CARE survey incorporates the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 10-item global health questionnaire to assess HRQoL, which includes physical and mental health subscales.28, 29\nPrognostic scales for cancer: France: (Canoui-Poitrine et al. 2022) 510 patients with cancer evaluated with multiple prognostic scales including CCI and Elixhauser.

EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC = 1.60, p = 0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC = - 4.53, p < 0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity.\nSEER no survival difference based upon race (Tramontano et al. 2018) T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p < 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors.\nNCDB comparison of hospitals (Sridhar et al. 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Could preferential use of High Burden Hospitals by racial minorities account for their worse outcomes?\nMichigan Cancer Registry marital status at the time of diagnosis (Paniagua Cruz et al. 2020) 88.4% of our patients were White and 11.6% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9% v 31.8%, respectively; P < .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment.Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes. Marital status at dx is a field in the CR Star data!!\nNCDB (Schlottmann et al. 2020) NCDB Stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. but was histology included in their model? Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. Is the negative effect on survival due to race or insurance status/geography?\n(Savitch et al. 2021) NCDB stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015 matched cohorts White:Black. 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery.

Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p < 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p < 0.001 for both).

Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival. **Another way of studying access to surgical care - this time at the facility level. Further su*pport for the theme that access to surgery is barrier to optimal esophageal cancer care.**\n(Erhunmwunsee et al. 2017) NCDB stage I-III 2003-2011. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p < 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p < 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. Did study include histology in their model?\n(Okereke et al. 2021) NCDB 2004-2017: 127,098 patients. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery).\n(Sridhar et al. 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities.

HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). Conclusions: There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH.\nCalifornia Cancer Registry (Tran et al. 2017) Esophageal cancer cases 2004-2010. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Sounds like receipt of surgery remains disparate based upon race and accounts for some differences in outcome\n\n\nNorth Carolina (Wong et al. 2021) compared per capita rate of surgery in 5 high-resource counties with 5 low-resource counties using is data from the Health Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database from 2016. Using the surgical rate observed in the 5 highest-ranked counties (HRCs), the expected surgical rate in the 5 lowest-ranked counties (LRCs) in North Carolina were calculated. Patients 18 years and older who underwent an inpatient general surgery procedure and patients who underwent emergency inpatient cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy, or bariatric surgery in 2016 were included. The primary outcome was the proportional surgical ratio (PSR), which was the disparity in surgical access defined as the observed number of surgical procedures in the 5 LRCs relative to the expected number of procedures using the 5 HRCs as the standardized reference population. In 2016, approximately 1.9 million adults lived in the 5 HRCs, while approximately 246 854 lived in the 5 LRCs. A total of 28 924 inpatient general surgical procedures were performed, with 4521 being performed in those living in the 5 LRCs and 24 403 in those living in the 5 HRCs. The rate of general surgery in the 5 HRCs was 13.09 procedures per 1000 population. Using the 5 HRCs as the reference, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.35-1.44). For emergent/urgent cholecystectomy, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 2.26 (95% CI, 2.02-2.51), and the PSR for emergent/urgent herniorrhaphy was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.33-2.45). Age-adjusted rate of obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] greater than 30), on average, was 36.6% (SD, 3.4) in the 5 LRCs vs 25.4% (SD, 4.6) in the 5 HRCs (P = .002). The rate of bariatric surgery in the 5 HRCs was 33.07 per 10 000 population with obesity. For the 5 LRCs, the PSR was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.51-0.69). Could we use this same database for esophagectomy? Need to figure out whether patients that have surgery in an read different from where they live are scored as their county of residence or county where surgery was done\n(degajer276?)\n\n\nAge - Sex - Race body composition standard Curves(Magudia et al. 2021)\n\nBackground Although CT-based body composition (BC) metrics may inform disease risk and outcomes, obtaining these metrics has been too resource intensive for large-scale use. Thus, population-wide distributions of BC remain uncertain. Purpose To demonstrate the validity of fully automated, deep learning BC analysis from abdominal CT examinations, to define demographically adjusted BC reference curves, and to illustrate the advantage of use of these curves compared with standard methods, along with their biologic significance in predicting survival. Materials and Methods After external validation and equivalency testing with manual segmentation, a fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was applied to a cross-sectional population cohort that included any outpatient without a cardiovascular disease or cancer who underwent abdominal CT examination at one of three hospitals in 2012. Demographically adjusted population reference curves were generated for each BC area. The z scores derived from these curves were compared with sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia by using χ2 tests and used to predict 2-year survival in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included weight and body mass index (BMI). Results External validation showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99) and equivalency (P < .001) of the fully automated deep learning BC analysis method with manual segmentation. With use of the fully automated BC data from 12 128 outpatients (mean age, 52 years; 6936 [57%] women), age-, race-, and sex-normalized BC reference curves were generated. All BC areas varied significantly with these variables (P < .001 except for subcutaneous fat area vs age [P = .003]). Sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia demonstrated that age and race bias were not present if z scores derived from the reference curves were used (P < .001). Skeletal muscle area z scores were significantly predictive of 2-year survival (P = .04) in combined models that included BMI. Conclusion Fully automated body composition (BC) metrics vary significantly by age, race, and sex. The z scores derived from reference curves for BC parameters better capture the demographic distribution of BC compared with standard methods and can help predict survival. Investigators at the University of Illinois {Jang et al. (2020)} examined the change in skeletal muscle index during cancer treatment among 212 patients. Among 132 non-Hispanic Black patients, muscle loss during therapy was greater than non-Hispanic White and Other (Asian + Hispanic) (Odds Ratio 3.29 p=0.004). The loss was highest in Black rectal cancer patients (11 units of SMI loss cm2/m2) vs White rectal Cancer (8 cm2/m2). Loss among colon cancer patients was higher in Black patients ( 5.5 cm2/m2) than in White patients (2.5 cm2/m2). Prior to treatment, Blacks had higher SMI than White (similar to findings of Xaio 2019)\n\nData from Kaiser (xaio615?) examined 3263 patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer. Black patients had higher lower rates of sarcopenia according to the definition of Prado et al. Patients with higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio had higher risk of muscle abnormality. CT scan at L3 was analyed to determine SMI,IMAT,VAT,SAT and TAT (=VAT+SAT+IMAT) using SliceOMatic. Threshold values determined for optimal stratification (cf (martin153?)

In multivariate analysis including age, sex, BMI, sarcopenia, SAT, and VAT, the only factor associated with Grade 3-4 toxicities was sarcopenia (odds ratio = 13.55; 95% confidence interval [1.08; 169.31], P = 0.043).{(barrett_Nutritionand?)

Muscle area on CT decreased by 6.1% over 3 months. Patients in the lowest tertile (loss of 9%) had worse survial. Overall survival 17.5 months for first-line chemotherapy and 8.5months for second-line. Baseline muscle density was predictive of survival on multivariable analysis, but low SMI at baseline was not associatesd with survival. (This may be because sarcopenic obesity is the major risk factor, and there were few obese patients in the study cohort) >Muscle loss of 9% or more remained independently associated with survival when adjusted for sex, age, baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, comorbidity, mono-organ or multiorgan metastases, treatment line, and tumor progression at first evaluation by computed tomography scan (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.21 to 9.05; P , .001). We found a mean coefficient of variation between observers of 0.6% for skeletal muscle area in a random sample of 20 patients, which is regarded to be low.(MacDonald, Greig, and Baracos 2011). Changes between the first and second scans were calculated as a rate of change per 3 months, meaning change per first evaluation, to compare with available literature.[awad74][prado1583]Relative muscle change per 3 months was categorized into tertiles of muscle change: tertile one, highest muscle loss up to 9%; tertile two, muscle loss of 9% to 1.5%; and tertile three, muscle loss of 1.5% until highest gain in muscle. However, the survival curve of tertile two was not significantly different from the survival curve of tertile three (log-rank P = .961); therefore tertiles two and three were pooled (cutoff, 9% muscle loss).\nAwad (Awad et al. 2012)studies changes in body composition during neodjuvant chemotherapy for esophagogastric cancer.\nKurk (Kurk et al. 2020) found that skeletal muscle loss during chemotherapy was associated with decreased progression-free and overall- survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nDetailed changes in skeletal muscle mass and body weight during CAIRO3 treatments were previously reported.KurkS, p909, 2018) We additionally analyzed changes in SMI and BMI during these treatments by linear mixed effects models.(Bayar MA,p311,2017) The baseline value of the outcome (SMI/BMI) was included in the outcome vector. Potential confounders were age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, best response to initial six cycles CAPOX‐B, resection of the primary tumor, and the number of metastatic sites. The final model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and included: treatment arm, time, age, sex, resection primary tumor, and the interaction of treatment arm by time as fixed effects. Modeling time as a random effect did not increase the model fit as indicated by the AIC. To investigate differences in SMI and BMI changes over time between the CAIRO3 treatment arms, we checked the significance of the two‐way interaction including treatment arm by time.\n\n\nDuring p2 (maintenance CAP‐B/observation), again absolute SMI and BMI at the start (t1) of treatment were not associated with early progression and death. In contrast, SMI loss and BMI loss during treatment were associated with early progression and death.\n\nFogelman (Fogelman et al. 2014) treated patients undergoing chemotherapy with a novel agent designed to reduce muscle less. CT scans at 2 months were compared with baseline scans prior to chemotherapy.\n\nChanges in skeletal muscle were determined using routinely acquired CT scans for patients on the study. We calculated skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). A single slice at the mid-point of L3 was used, preferably a 2.5-mm slice if available, and a 5-mm slice if a 2.5-mm slice was not available. The L3 is a landmark that has been extensively used and validated in studies assessing body composition in cancer patients [Shen et al. (2004)](C. M. M. Prado, Birdsell, and Baracos 2009) . Skeletal muscle surface areas were determined using Slice-o-Matic softwareTM, version 4.3 (Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada) using pre-established thresholds of Hounsfield units (HU) of −29 to +150 (Mitsiopoulos et al. 1998). We additionally evaluated adipose tissue cross-sectional area (subcutaneous, visceral, and intramuscular) in the L3 region as described previously (Mourtzakis et al. 2008). Changes in muscle and adipose tissue surface areas over time were determined for each patient from the baseline study to the first CT post treatment, done after 2 months. We looked at muscle loss as a continuous variable and defined “meaningful loss” as greater than a 6 cm2 difference from the baseline to the second scan. We chose this cut point as it is equivalent to 1 kg of skeletal muscle and is associated with physical function (i.e., muscle strength). Additionally, this cut point has been used to investigate significant changes in muscle mass throughout cancer disease trajectory [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al. 1988)(C. M. Prado et al. 2013).\n\nPrado (C. M. Prado et al. 2013) looked at changes in 1279 CT scans in 368 patients with advanced cancer. The last available interval with CT scans was chosen for comparison. Categorized into stable, gaining, losing for muscle and for adipose tissue. Adipose tissue was ?? sum of visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous tissue. (Did not use SMI). Muscel loss and adipose loss seemed correlated, with larger magnitude of adipose tissue loss at short interval to death. (Authors conclusion that muscle and adipose tissue loss in the past 3 months of life is likely not possible) >Advanced-cancer patients (n = 368; median survival: 196 d) had a total of 1279 CT images over the course of their disease. With consideration of all time points, muscle loss occurred in 39% of intervals between any 2 scans. However, the overall frequency of muscle gain was 15.4%, and muscle was stable in 45.6% of intervals between any 2 scans, which made the maintenance or gain of muscle the predominant behavior. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that being within 90 d (compared with >90 d) from death was the principal risk factor for muscle loss (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.94; P = 0.002), and muscle gain was correspondingly less likely (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.69; P = 0.002) at this time. Sex, age, BMI, and tumor group were not significant predictors of muscle loss or gain. A much higher proportion of men (61%) than women (31%) met the criteria for sarcopenia. Changes in muscle and adipose tissue over time were calculated as the absolute loss or gain of tissue area during each scan interval. The precision error of measurements was ~1.5% (Mourtzakis et al. 2008) with a minimum detectable change of ~3 cm2. We attributed the change during each interval into the following categories: 1) muscle loss ≥6.0 cm2, 2) stable muscle ±5.9 cm2, or 3) muscle gain ≥6.0cm2. These cutoffs are equivalent to a loss or gain of ≥1 kg of skeletal muscle on a whole-body basis and are associated with alterations in muscle strength [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al. 1988). For adipose tissue, categories were based on the equivalence of 14.7 cm2 total fat at L3 and 1 kg tissue on a whole-body basis (Shen et al. 2004); therefore, changes during each interval were categorized as 1) adipose tissue loss ≥14.7 cm2, 2) stable adipose tissue ±14.6 cm2, or 3) adipose tissue gain ≥14.7 cm2. CT scans were taken for the diagnosis, confirmation of stage, and follow-up of disease progression and treatment. With the understanding that cachexia evolves markedly in the end of life and to take advantage of repeated measures, we focused on patients with ≥2 CT images (2–6 images) on record during the year preceding their deaths (n = 368). A selection bias was not apparent in this sample; we showed that the sex distribution, age at death, survival time, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, and body-composition features (ie, muscle and adipose tissues) in patients who had only a single scan were not different from those of the overall cohort at an equal time to death (P > 0.1). Patients included in the analysis (n = 368) were of advanced stage, and the median time to death of all groups was <1 y.\nSimilar study by Tan looking at longitudinal body composition in pancreatic cancer (Tan et al. 2009). 111 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer: 44 identified with more than one scan. Patients who underwent repeated CT scans were more likely to receive active therapy (71%) and had longer survival than those who had a solitary CT scan (28% receiving active chemotherapy). OVeral median survival 130 days. Age and sarcopenic obesity predicted survival. Sarcopenic obesity had survival of 55 days vs 148 days for those without sarcopenia obesity. Muscle loss was normalized to percent during 100 days. Median interval between scans was ??135 days. Patients grouped in tertiles for muscle gain/loss. Top tertile gained 7% muscle cross-sectional area/100 days, while bottom tertile lost 12% over 100 days. All tertiles lost adipose tissue. No difference in survival between the tertiles. > muscle loss was the prevalent behavior, but 14% of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (considered the disease most highly associated with cachexia) exhibited a muscle gain of 7.9 ± 14.4%/100 d).\nLieffers and advanced colorectal cancer: Found liver and spleen increased in size in terminal patients (causing increase in basal metabolic rate). Found more rapid muscle loss with progressive disease (Lieffers et al. 2009). Different thresholds for VAT (-150 to -50) and SAT(-190 to -30). Also estimated muscel surface area using measurements 5cm above L4(Shen et al. 2004). Most rapid change in body composition between 4 months and 1 month prior to death. >14% of patients gained skeletal muscle during the year preceding death from colorectal cancer (+4.7 ± 5.4%/100 d).\nLongitudinal study of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (all with <1yr survival). (Baracos et al. 2010) >At referral (median time to death: 265 d), mean body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) was 24.9, with 47.4% of patients being overweight or obese. Only 7.5% overall were underweight as conventionally understood (BMI < 18.5). Analysis of computed tomography images showed extremely high heterogeneity of muscle mass within all strata of BMI. The overall prevalence of severe muscle depletion (sarcopenia) was 46.8% and was present in patients in all BMI categories.\nCaan (Caan et al. 2017) examined body composition and survival from colorecal cncer at Kaiser.\n\n\n\nPMID 34774016"

    "text": "Axial CT scanning has facilitated the estimation of body composition analysis, which has focused upon the skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle density, and visceral adipose tissue.\nThe most common facile measure of muscle mass is the cross-sectional area and density of muscle at the L3 level, as measured on abdominal CT scan {Prado, 2008 #1848;Fearon, 2011 #1851;Mourtzakis, 2008 #1853}. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (MSA) is most commonly measured at the L3 level using image analysis software to identify all tissue between -29 and 150 Hounsfield Units {Martin, 2013 #1965}.\nA less common, but faster method is the extrapolation of muscle mass from the psoas diameter {Peng, 2011 #1946;Jones, 2015 #1959}, but some comparative studies have questioned the predictive ability of psoas diameter {Rutten, 2017 #1979;Martin, 2013 #1965;Ebadi,  #1982} as a substitute for muscle cross-sectional area.\nCross-sectional muscle area is frequently normalized to body height to calculate the Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI).\nReduction in muscle mass can also be accompanied by an increased proportion of intra-muscular fat {Delmonico,  #1983}. The density of muscle mass on cross-sectional imaging has been used to estimate the Skeletal Muscle Density (SMD), which represents fatty infiltration of the muscle, which is based upon the differential density of fat and muscle on CT imaging.\nVisceral adipose tissue (VAT) can be measured in similar fashion to skeletal muscle, using analysis of axial CT images.\nPublished literature quotes an interobserver coefficient of variation of 1.5% {Prado, 2008 #1848}\nIV Contrast Tube current - (Fuchs et al. 2018) Slice Thickness (Morsbach et al. 2019) Contrasst challenges (Bae 2010) Muscle L4 contrast (Boutin et al. 2016) IV contrast and muscle size (van der Werf et al. 2018) (van Vugt et al. 2018) kV(morsbach9?)\nICC 24/35/42 (Fuchs et al. 2018) (van der Werf et al. 2018) (Barnard et al. 2019) (Perthen et al. 2018)\nMachine learning 43-46 (Jang et al. 2019) ML methods from Lung Cancer Screening Trial.

Additional preparation of ground truth data used the ImageMath and fslstats programs of the Advanced Normalization Tools [74] and FMRIB Software Library [75] respectively.

You should read the remark.js Wiki at least once to know how to\n\ncreate a new slide (Markdown syntax* and slide properties);\nformat a slide (e.g. text alignment);\nconfigure the slideshow;\nand use the presentation (keyboard shortcuts).\n\nIt is important to be familiar with remark.js before you can understand the options in xaringan.\n.footnote[[*] It is different with Pandoc’s Markdown! It is limited but should be enough for presentation purposes. Come on… You do not need a slide for the Table of Contents! Well, the Markdown support in remark.js may be improved in the future.]\nclass: inverse, middle, center\n\n\nUsing xaringan\n\n\n\nxaringan\nProvides an R Markdown output format xaringan::moon_reader as a wrapper for remark.js, and you can use it in the YAML metadata, e.g.\n---\ntitle: \"A Cool Presentation\"\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    yolo: true\n    nature:\n      autoplay: 30000\n---\nSee the help page ?xaringan::moon_reader for all possible options that you can use.\n\n\n\nremark.js vs xaringan\nSome differences between using remark.js (left) and using xaringan (right):\n.pull-left[ 1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;\n\nPlain Markdown;\nWrite JavaScript to autoplay slides;\nManually configure MathJax;\nHighlight code with *;\nEdit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides; ]\n\n.pull-right[ 1. Start with an R Markdown document;\n\nR Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);\nProvide an option autoplay;\nMathJax just works;*\nHighlight code with {{}};\nThe RStudio addin “Infinite Moon Reader” automatically refreshes slides on changes; ]\n\n.footnote[[*] Not really. See next page.]\n\n\n\nMath Expressions\nYou can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. $+$ renders \\(\\alpha+\\beta\\). You can use the display style with double dollar signs:\n$$\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$\n\\[\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\]\nLimitations:\n\nThe source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting $$ must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending $$ must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;\nThere should not be spaces after the opening $ or before the closing $.\nMath does not work on the title slide (see #61 for a workaround).\n\n\n\n\nR Code\n\n# a boring regression\nfit = lm(dist ~ 1 + speed, data = cars)\ncoef(summary(fit))\n\n#               Estimate Std. Error   t value     Pr(>|t|)\n# (Intercept) -17.579095  6.7584402 -2.601058 1.231882e-02\n# speed         3.932409  0.4155128  9.463990 1.489836e-12\n\ndojutsu = c('地爆天星', '天照', '加具土命', '神威', '須佐能乎', '無限月読')\ngrep('天', dojutsu, value = TRUE)\n\n# [1] \"地爆天星\" \"天照\"\n\n\n\n\n\nR Plots\n\npar(mar = c(4, 4, 1, .1))\nplot(cars, pch = 19, col = 'darkgray', las = 1)\nabline(fit, lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables\nIf you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,\n\nknitr::kable(head(iris), format = 'html')\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Sepal.Length \n    Sepal.Width \n    Petal.Length \n    Petal.Width \n    Species \n  \n \n\n  \n    5.1 \n    3.5 \n    1.4 \n    0.2 \n    setosa \n  \n  \n    4.9 \n    3.0 \n    1.4 \n    0.2 \n    setosa \n  \n  \n    4.7 \n    3.2 \n    1.3 \n    0.2 \n    setosa \n  \n  \n    4.6 \n    3.1 \n    1.5 \n    0.2 \n    setosa \n  \n  \n    5.0 \n    3.6 \n    1.4 \n    0.2 \n    setosa \n  \n  \n    5.4 \n    3.9 \n    1.7 \n    0.4 \n    setosa \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML Widgets\nI have not thoroughly tested HTML widgets against xaringan. Some may work well, and some may not. It is a little tricky.\nSimilarly, the Shiny mode (runtime: shiny) does not work. I might get these issues fixed in the future, but these are not of high priority to me. I never turn my presentation into a Shiny app. When I need to demonstrate more complicated examples, I just launch them separately. It is convenient to share slides with other people when they are plain HTML/JS applications.\nSee the next page for two HTML widgets.\n\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDT::datatable(\n  head(iris, 10),\n  fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 8)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Tips\n\nDo not forget to try the yolo option of xaringan::moon_reader.\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    yolo: true\n\n\n\n\nSome Tips\n\nSlides can be automatically played if you set the autoplay option under nature, e.g. go to the next slide every 30 seconds in a lightning talk:\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    nature:\n      autoplay: 30000\nIf you want to restart the play after it reaches the last slide, you may set the sub-option loop to TRUE, e.g.,\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    nature:\n      autoplay:\n        interval: 30000\n        loop: true\n\n\n\n\nSome Tips\n\nA countdown timer can be added to every page of the slides using the countdown option under nature, e.g. if you want to spend one minute on every page when you give the talk, you can set:\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    nature:\n      countdown: 60000\nThen you will see a timer counting down from 01:00, to 00:59, 00:58, … When the time is out, the timer will continue but the time turns red.\n\n\n\n\nSome Tips\n\nThe title slide is created automatically by xaringan, but it is just another remark.js slide added before your other slides.\nThe title slide is set to class: center, middle, inverse, title-slide by default. You can change the classes applied to the title slide with the titleSlideClass option of nature (title-slide is always applied).\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    nature:\n      titleSlideClass: [top, left, inverse]\n\n–\n\nIf you’d like to create your own title slide, disable xaringan’s title slide with the seal = FALSE option of moon_reader.\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    seal: false\n\n\n\n\nSome Tips\n\nThere are several ways to build incremental slides. See this presentation for examples.\nThe option highlightLines: true of nature will highlight code lines that start with *, or are wrapped in {{ }}, or have trailing comments #<<;\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    nature:\n      highlightLines: true\nSee examples on the next page.\n\n\n\n\nSome Tips\n.pull-left[ An example using a leading *:\n```r\nif (TRUE) {\n** message(\"Very important!\")\n}\n```\nOutput:\nif (TRUE) {\n* message(\"Very important!\")\n}\nThis is invalid R code, so it is a plain fenced code block that is not executed. ]\n.pull-right[ An example using {{}}:\n```{r tidy=FALSE}\nif (TRUE) {\n*{{ message(\"Very important!\") }}\n}\n```\nOutput:\n\nif (TRUE) {\n{{ message(\"Very important!\") }}\n}\n\nVery important!\n\n\nIt is valid R code so you can run it. Note that {{}} can wrap an R expression of multiple lines. ]\n\n\n\nSome Tips\nAn example of using the trailing comment #<< to highlight lines:\n```{r tidy=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(mtcars) + \n  aes(mpg, disp) + \n  geom_point() +   #<<\n  geom_smooth()    #<<\n```\nOutput:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(mtcars) + \n  aes(mpg, disp) + \n  geom_point() +   #<<\n  geom_smooth()    #<<\n\n\n\n\nSome Tips\nWhen you enable line-highlighting, you can also use the chunk option highlight.output to highlight specific lines of the text output from a code chunk. For example, highlight.output = TRUE means highlighting all lines, and highlight.output = c(1, 3) means highlighting the first and third line.\n```{r, highlight.output=c(1, 3)}\nhead(iris)\n```\n\n\n  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n\n\nQuestion: what does highlight.output = c(TRUE, FALSE) mean? (Hint: think about R’s recycling of vectors)\n\n\n\nSome Tips\n\nTo make slides work offline, you need to download a copy of remark.js in advance, because xaringan uses the online version by default (see the help page ?xaringan::moon_reader).\nYou can use xaringan::summon_remark() to download the latest or a specified version of remark.js. By default, it is downloaded to libs/remark-latest.min.js.\nThen change the chakra option in YAML to point to this file, e.g.\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    chakra: libs/remark-latest.min.js\nIf you used Google fonts in slides (the default theme uses Yanone Kaffeesatz, Droid Serif, and Source Code Pro), they won’t work offline unless you download or install them locally. The Heroku app google-webfonts-helper can help you download fonts and generate the necessary CSS.\n\n\n\n\nMacros\n\nremark.js allows users to define custom macros (JS functions) that can be applied to Markdown text using the syntax ![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...] or ![:macroName arg1, arg2, ...](this). For example, before remark.js initializes the slides, you can define a macro named scale:\nremark.macros.scale = function (percentage) {\n  var url = this;\n  return '<img src=\"' + url + '\" style=\"width: ' + percentage + '\" />';\n};\nThen the Markdown text\n![:scale 50%](image.jpg)\nwill be translated to\n<img src=\"image.jpg\" style=\"width: 50%\" />\n\n\n\n\nMacros (continued)\n\nTo insert macros in xaringan slides, you can use the option beforeInit under the option nature, e.g.,\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    nature:\n      beforeInit: \"macros.js\"\nYou save your remark.js macros in the file macros.js.\nThe beforeInit option can be used to insert arbitrary JS code before remark.create(). Inserting macros is just one of its possible applications.\n\n\n\n\nCSS\nAmong all options in xaringan::moon_reader, the most challenging but perhaps also the most rewarding one is css, because it allows you to customize the appearance of your slides using any CSS rules or hacks you know.\nYou can see the default CSS file here. You can completely replace it with your own CSS files, or define new rules to override the default. See the help page ?xaringan::moon_reader for more information.\n\n\n\nCSS\nFor example, suppose you want to change the font for code from the default “Source Code Pro” to “Ubuntu Mono”. You can create a CSS file named, say, ubuntu-mono.css:\n@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Ubuntu+Mono:400,700,400italic);\n\n.remark-code, .remark-inline-code { font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'; }\nThen set the css option in the YAML metadata:\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    css: [\"default\", \"ubuntu-mono.css\"]\nHere I assume ubuntu-mono.css is under the same directory as your Rmd.\nSee yihui/xaringan#83 for an example of using the Fira Code font, which supports ligatures in program code.\n\n\n\nCSS (with Sass)\nxaringan also supports Sass support via rmarkdown. Suppose you want to use the same color for different elements, e.g., first heading and bold text. You can create a .scss file, say mytheme.scss, using the sass syntax with variables:\n$mycolor: #ff0000; \n.remark-slide-content > h1 { color: $mycolor; }\n.remark-slide-content strong { color: $mycolor; }\nThen set the css option in the YAML metadata using this file placed under the same directory as your Rmd:\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    css: [\"default\", \"mytheme.scss\"]\nThis requires rmarkdown >= 2.8 and the sass package. You can learn more about rmarkdown and sass support in this blog post and in sass overview vignette.\n\n\n\nThemes\nDon’t want to learn CSS? Okay, you can use some user-contributed themes. A theme typically consists of two CSS files foo.css and foo-fonts.css, where foo is the theme name. Below are some existing themes:\n\nnames(xaringan:::list_css())\n\n [1] \"chocolate-fonts\"  \"chocolate\"        \"default-fonts\"   \n [4] \"default\"          \"duke-blue\"        \"fc-fonts\"        \n [7] \"fc\"               \"glasgow_template\" \"hygge-duke\"      \n[10] \"hygge\"            \"ki-fonts\"         \"ki\"              \n[13] \"kunoichi\"         \"lucy-fonts\"       \"lucy\"            \n[16] \"metropolis-fonts\" \"metropolis\"       \"middlebury-fonts\"\n[19] \"middlebury\"       \"nhsr-fonts\"       \"nhsr\"            \n[22] \"ninjutsu\"         \"rladies-fonts\"    \"rladies\"         \n[25] \"robot-fonts\"      \"robot\"            \"rutgers-fonts\"   \n[28] \"rutgers\"          \"shinobi\"          \"tamu-fonts\"      \n[31] \"tamu\"             \"uio-fonts\"        \"uio\"             \n[34] \"uo-fonts\"         \"uo\"               \"uol-fonts\"       \n[37] \"uol\"              \"useR-fonts\"       \"useR\"            \n[40] \"uwm-fonts\"        \"uwm\"             \n\n\n\n\n\nThemes\nTo use a theme, you can specify the css option as an array of CSS filenames (without the .css extensions), e.g.,\noutput:\n  xaringan::moon_reader:\n    css: [default, metropolis, metropolis-fonts]\nIf you want to contribute a theme to xaringan, please read this blog post.\nbackground-image: url(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Sharingan_triple.svg) background-size: 100px background-position: 90% 8%\n\n\nSharingan\nThe R package name xaringan was derived1 from Sharingan, a dōjutsu in the Japanese anime Naruto with two abilities:\n\nthe “Eye of Insight”\nthe “Eye of Hypnotism”\n\nI think a presentation is basically a way to communicate insights to the audience, and a great presentation may even “hypnotize” the audience.2,3\n.footnote[ [1] In Chinese, the pronounciation of X is Sh /ʃ/ (as in shrimp). Now you should have a better idea of how to pronounce my last name Xie.\n[2] By comparison, bad presentations only put the audience to sleep.\n[3] Personally I find that setting background images for slides is a killer feature of remark.js. It is an effective way to bring visual impact into your presentations. ]\n\n\n\nNaruto terminology\nThe xaringan package borrowed a few terms from Naruto, such as\n\nSharingan (写輪眼; the package name)\nThe moon reader (月読; an attractive R Markdown output format)\nChakra (查克拉; the path to the remark.js library, which is the power to drive the presentation)\nNature transformation (性質変化; transform the chakra by setting different options)\nThe infinite moon reader (無限月読; start a local web server to continuously serve your slides)\nThe summoning technique (download remark.js from the web)\n\nYou can click the links to know more about them if you want. The jutsu “Moon Reader” may seem a little evil, but that does not mean your slides are evil.\n\nclass: center\n\n\nHand seals (印)\nPress h or ? to see the possible ninjutsu you can use in remark.js.\n\n\nclass: center, middle\n\n\nThanks!\nSlides created via the R package xaringan.\nThe chakra comes from remark.js, knitr, and R Markdown."
