Improvement seen in six-minute walk test, but no difference in complications or operative mortality.\non the return of functional activity after a major surgical procedure. Hence, efforts to optimize functional capacity prior to surgery have shown improved outcomes for some abdominal and oncologic surgeries [20]. A multimodal approach termed as ‘prehabilitation’ comprising nutritional supplementation, psychological counselling, medical optimization, and a structured exercise program involving both aerobic and strengthening activity has been proposed to improve outcomes [21]. Respiratory optimization with deep breathing exercises, spirometry, and inspiratory muscle training decreases pulmonary complications [22]. Studies have shown that prehabilitation reduces anxiety, depression and fatigue, and improves the quality of life [23]. Preliminary results from a recently concluded study [24] on prehabilitation for esophageal surgery demonstrated improvement in functional capacity; however, the impact on postoperative outcomes needs to be evaluated by further ongoing studies [25]. Extrapolation from studies on other abdominal surgeries [20] suggests that at least 4 weeks of preoperative prehabilitation is better than postoperative rehabilitation to influence outcomes. As most patients with operable esophageal cancer would receive neoadjuvant treatment, it would be opportunistic to use this preoperative window to initiate prehabilitation.\nA feasibility trial of prehabilitation before oesophagogastric cancer surgery using a multi-component home-based exercise programme: the ChemoFit study.(Chmelo et al. 2022)\nThe Role of Prehabilitation in Modern Esophagogastric Cancer Surgery: A Comprehensive Review.(Bausys et al. 2022)\nPrehab (Gillis et al. 2018)"

    "text": "The patient with esophageal cancer faces multiple challenges in changes in body composition related to both muscle mass and adipose tissue. Patients frequently present with loss of adipose tissue and muscle from dysphaghia due to the primary tumor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation can improve oral intake due to tumor shrinkage, but can also decrease oral nutrition due to esophagitis and the catabolic effects of cytotoxic therapy.  In addition, patients undergoing esophagectomy frequently lose weight due to limited oral intake and the catabolic effects of the stress of surgery.\nFor patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy, the chemoradiation treatment prior to surgery can be seen as a ‘stress test\\’ which can further assist in evaluating a patient’s resilience to the stress of surgery.\nThe coexistence of sarcopenia and obesity has led to the identification of a syndrome of sarcopenia obesity, defined as sarcopenia in the context of a BMI >30kg/m^2. These patients suffer the consequences of both loss of muscle mass with excess adipose tissue, which appear to act synergistically to decrease survival in cancer patients.{prado, 629; martin}"

    "text": "Axial CT scanning has facilitated the estimation of body composition analysis, which has focused upon the skeletal muscle mass, skeletal muscle density, and visceral adipose tissue.\nThe most common facile measure of muscle mass is the cross-sectional area and density of muscle at the L3 level, as measured on abdominal CT scan {Prado, 2008 #1848;Fearon, 2011 #1851;Mourtzakis, 2008 #1853}. Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (MSA) is most commonly measured at the L3 level using image analysis software to identify all tissue between -29 and 150 Hounsfield Units {Martin, 2013 #1965}.\nA less common, but faster method is the extrapolation of muscle mass from the psoas diameter {Peng, 2011 #1946;Jones, 2015 #1959}, but some comparative studies have questioned the predictive ability of psoas diameter {Rutten, 2017 #1979;Martin, 2013 #1965;Ebadi,  #1982} as a substitute for muscle cross-sectional area.\nCross-sectional muscle area is frequently normalized to body height to calculate the Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI).\nReduction in muscle mass can also be accompanied by an increased proportion of intra-muscular fat {Delmonico,  #1983}. The density of muscle mass on cross-sectional imaging has been used to estimate the Skeletal Muscle Density (SMD), which represents fatty infiltration of the muscle, which is based upon the differential density of fat and muscle on CT imaging.\nVisceral adipose tissue (VAT) can be measured in similar fashion to skeletal muscle, using analysis of axial CT images.\nPublished literature quotes an interobserver coefficient of variation of 1.5% {Prado, 2008 #1848}\n\n\nIV Contrast Tube current - (Fuchs et al. 2018) Slice Thickness (Morsbach et al. 2019) Contrasst challenges (Bae 2010) Muscle L4 contrast (Boutin et al. 2016) IV contrast and muscle size (van der Werf et al. 2018) (van Vugt et al. 2018) kV(morsbach9?)\nICC 24/35/42 (Fuchs et al. 2018) (van der Werf et al. 2018) (Barnard et al. 2019) (Perthen et al. 2018)\nMachine learning 43-46 (Jang et al. 2019) ML methods from Lung Cancer Screening Trial.
