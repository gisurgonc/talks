The early recovery group had fewer pulmonary complications (17% vs 33%) and fewer overall complications (33% vs 52%). No difference in anastomotic leakage (12% vs 16%). No difference in length of stay or pain scores(Shen et al. 2022).\nMeta-analysis (Pisarska et al. 2017), included 2042 patients (1058 in an ERAS group vs 984 in a traditional group), revealed a significantly shorter hospital stay and fewer non-surgical and pulmonary complications in the ERAS group, but no effect on overall morbidity, mortality or readmission rates.\nMeta-analysis of 13 reports of enhanced recovery protocols performed a regression analysis to identify factors which may be important in length of stay reductions. These factors included immediate extubation, early gastrograffin study, early urinary catheter removal, early feeding with at least sips of water on the first postoperative day, early enteral feeding, and epidural catheter removal within 4 days(Markar et al. 2017).\nVirginia Mason ERAS (Schmidt et al. 2016)\n\n\n\nPatients with esophageal cancer frequently suffer from undernutrition due to GI tract obstruction and the pro-inflammatory effects of cancer and the effects of neoadjuvant therapy. Preoperative evaluation should include history of weight loss, dysphagia, odynophagia.\nMalnutrition Screening Tool is a simple two-question screening tool which can triage patients for more detailed nutritional evaluation.(Skipper et al. 2020) (Shaw et al. 2015)\nMalnutrition can be graded as mild, moderate, or severe (White et al. 2012)\nModerate malnutrition is characterized by weight loss of 5% in 1 month, 7.5% in 3 months, or 10% in 6 months. Severe malnutrition is characterized by weight loss >7.5% in 3 months, and >10% in 6 months, or >20% in 1 year.\nNutrition support from has been suggested to improve outcomes after esophagectomy in retrospective studies.(Ligthart-Melis et al. 2013) ESPN (ASPEN?) guidelines suggest strategies for nutritional support in cancer patients.(Arends et al. 2017)\nSee Bower and Martin 19373870\nCriteria for utility of feeding tubes with esophageal cancer(Huerter et al. 2016)\nJ tubes; 46\nBen-David K , Kim T , Caban A M , Rossidis G , Rodriguez S S , Hochwald S N .

Gastrostomy placement, particularly via the endoscopic approach (PEG) runs the risk of damage to the right gastroepiploic vascular arcade, which might devascularize a future gastric conduit(Ohnmacht et al. 2006), although small series suggest that this risk is low (Margolis et al. 2003).\nA meta-analysis of over 1000 patients treated with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy prior to esophagectomy found no differences in anastomtic leak rate and no instances of conduit failure due to PEG placement (Fang et al. 2022)\nAnecdotal data suggests that esophagectommy with gastric conduit can safely be performed after gastrostomy, particularly if placement is done via laparoscopy and if the tube can be removed prior to esophagectomy to allow the tract to heal. PEG placement (via endoscopy) runs a small but finite risk of seeding of the gastrostomy tract with tumor.(Ellrichmann et al. 2013)\n\n\n\nFrailty (Fried et al. 2004) Clinical Frailty Score (7-point) predicts death and need for institutional care at 5 years from Canadian Health study (Rockwood et al. 2005)\nFrailty and major surgery (McIsaac, Bryson, and van Walraven 2016) (Mosquera, Spaniolas, and Fitzgerald 2016)\n\n\n\nCardiopulmonary testing has not been shown to be of proven value in peroperative assement of surgical fitness prior to esophagectomy (Drummond et al. 2018)\n6minute walk test predicts outcome after esophagectomy (Inoue et al. 2020)\nreview of cardiopulmonary testing: (Older, Hall, and Hader 1999)\nShuttle walk and cardiopulmonary testing in esophagectomy (Whibley et al. 2018)\nRoutine pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy fitness testing is not indicated for oesophagogastric cancer surgery.

Improvement seen in six-minute walk test, but no difference in complications or operative mortality.\non the return of functional activity after a major surgical procedure. Hence, efforts to optimize functional capacity prior to surgery have shown improved outcomes for some abdominal and oncologic surgeries [20]. A multimodal approach termed as ‘prehabilitation’ comprising nutritional supplementation, psychological counselling, medical optimization, and a structured exercise program involving both aerobic and strengthening activity has been proposed to improve outcomes [21]. Respiratory optimization with deep breathing exercises, spirometry, and inspiratory muscle training decreases pulmonary complications [22]. Studies have shown that prehabilitation reduces anxiety, depression and fatigue, and improves the quality of life [23]. Preliminary results from a recently concluded study [24] on prehabilitation for esophageal surgery demonstrated improvement in functional capacity; however, the impact on postoperative outcomes needs to be evaluated by further ongoing studies [25]. Extrapolation from studies on other abdominal surgeries [20] suggests that at least 4 weeks of preoperative prehabilitation is better than postoperative rehabilitation to influence outcomes. As most patients with operable esophageal cancer would receive neoadjuvant treatment, it would be opportunistic to use this preoperative window to initiate prehabilitation.\nA feasibility trial of prehabilitation before oesophagogastric cancer surgery using a multi-component home-based exercise programme: the ChemoFit study.(Chmelo et al. 2022)\nThe Role of Prehabilitation in Modern Esophagogastric Cancer Surgery: A Comprehensive Review.(Bausys et al. 2022)\nPrehab (Gillis et al. 2018)"

    "text": "Sarcopenia Methods Sarcopenia in GI Cancers Sarcopenia in Chemotherapy Esophageal Cancer Therapy\nThe patient with esophageal cancer faces multiple challenges in changes in body composition related to both muscle mass and adipose tissue. Patients frequently present with loss of adipose tissue and muscle from dysphaghia due to the primary tumor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation can improve oral intake due to tumor shrinkage, but can also decrease oral nutrition due to esophagitis and the catabolic effects of cytotoxic therapy.  In addition, patients undergoing esophagectomy frequently lose weight due to limited oral intake and the catabolic effects of the stress of surgery.\nFor patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy, the chemoradiation treatment prior to surgery can be seen as a ‘stress test’ which can further assist in evaluating a patient’s resilience to the stress of surgery.\nThe coexistence of sarcopenia and obesity has led to the identification of a syndrome of sarcopenia obesity, defined as sarcopenia in the context of a BMI >30kg/m^2. These patients suffer the consequences of both loss of muscle mass with excess adipose tissue, which appear to act synergistically to decrease survival in cancer patients.(prado629?) (martin?)\n\n\nA Japanese group of 190 patients undergoing esophagectomy were studied. Sarcopenia was found in 149 (75%).[(nishigori?)]{Nishigori, 2016 #1996} Among sarcopenic patients, pneumonia occurred in 44 (29%) vs 5 (10%) among patients without sarcopenia. Another group(Ida?) {Ida, 2015 #1995} found similar association between sarcopenia and pulmonary complications after esophagectomy.\nA Japanese study examined the predictive value of sarcopenia relative to anastomotic after esophagectomy(Tamandl et al. 2016). While sarcopenia in patients under age 65 was not associated with adverse outcomes, among 166 patients over age 65, sarcopenia was associated with increased risk of anastomotic leak and in-hospital mortality.\nAmong 98 Japanese patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, 31 (31%) were found to be sarcopenic. Among these patients the 90-day readmission rate was 42.9% vs 16% in those without sarcopenia(makiura456?). In addition, sarcopenia was associated with overall survival after adjusting for age, gender, and pathologic stage.\nIrish study (Elliott et al. 2017)\n\n\n\nNottingham: 89 patients with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

(Awad et al. 2012)\nA small group of patients (n=35) with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation showed an increase in the percentage rated as sarcopenic as a result of chemoradiation {Yip, 2014 #2001}. Investigators in the UK noted similar changes in muscle mass among 14 patients as a result of neoadjuvant chemotherapy{Awad, 2012 #1990}. Neither study showed differences between loss of muscle mass and length of stay or survival, although neither study included a power analysis of these outcomes. A larger study from the Netherlands (n=123) {Reisinger, 2015 #1993} showed no association between muscle mass loss in mortality in the overall group, but did find a significant difference in mortality in 62 patients with stage III or IV disease.\nAmong 123 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation,the loss of muscle mass during chemoradiation (as measured by skeletal muscle CSA) was predictive of postoperative mortality {Reisinger, #1993}. Muscle loss was 13.5% in patients with complication-related mortality, and 8% in those without.\nMiyata H, Sugimura K, Motoori M, Fujiwara Y, Omori T, Yanagimoto Y, Ohue M, Yasui M, Miyoshi N, Tomokuni A, et al. Clinical assessment of sarcopenia and changes in body composition during neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer (Miyata et al. 2017)\n\n\n\nDaly LE, Ni Bhuachalla EB, Power DG, Cushen SJ, James K, Ryan AM.

Among these patients.{Makiura, 2018 #2007} sarcopenia was associated with overall survival after adjusting for age, gender, and pathologic stage.\nA meta-analysis of 4 studies totaling 649 patients showed that sarcopenia was associated with a survival hazard ratio of 1.5 compared with non-sarcopenia patients {Shachar, 2017 #2122}.\nPatients undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy showed that among 230 patients, psoas muscle area was associated with post-operative survival among 64 patient who did not undergo neoadjuvant therapy, but was not a significant predictor on multivariable analysis among patients who received neoadjuvant therapy.{Sheetz, 2013 #1999}\nMeta-analysis of 11 studies found that sarcopenia was associated with decreased survival after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer (Deng et al. 2019)\nSarcopenia and survival and unplanned admissions after esophagectomy (makiura456?)\nSarcopenia and postop pulmonary complications after esophagectomy (makiura430?)"

Survival benefit of surgery over chemoradiation in all ages, including octogenarians.\nSEER (Lv et al. 2021) 1596 Elderly patients with esophageal cancer: 278 had surgery.  Longer survival with trimodality therapy.\nThe perioperative period is when patients are at most risk of developing cardiopulmonary complications with an operative mortality rate of 13.4% in those who are between 70–79 years old and 19.9% in those over the age of 80 (7,8).\nOperative mortality after esophagectomy in those over age 80 is 19.9% (vs 8.8% under age 90) from National Inpatient Sample data (Finlayson, Fan, and Birkmeyer 2007)\n\n\nFrailty and complications after esophagectomy\nDublin (elliott822b?) Sarcopenia present in XX % and was associated with increased risk of perioperative complications. Sarcopenia was not associated with hospital mortality, which was 1%. Sarcopenia was associated with reduced 5-year survival, as was loss of muscle mass during neoadjuvant therapy.\nReview of sarcopenia and outcomes after GI cancer surgery (Su et al. 2019) Sarcopenia associated with increased risk of postoperative complications and decreased survival after esophagectomy.\nNegative impact of muscle wasting after chemotherapy followed by surgery (Mayanagi et al. 2017) 66 pts\nSarcopenia as a predictor of pulmonary complications after esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer (Nishigori et al. 2016)\n\n\nFrailty and survival after esophagectomy\nEsophageal cancer 341 patients, of whom 170 over age 65 (Nakashima et al. 2018) sarcopenia predicted short term outcome and survival, but only in patients over age 65\nVienna: 130 patients with esophageal cancer getting neoadjuvant chemotherapy, of whom 80 had sarcopenia (Paireder et al. 2017) Sarcopenia associated with shorter survival (HR 1.72)\n200 patients with esophageal cancer of whom 130 (65%) had sarcopenia (Tamandl et al. 2016) patients with sarcopenia had decreased survival.\nSarcopenia associated with decreased survival (p=0.035) in node-negative esophageal cancer patients after surgery (but not with node-positive).(Harada et al. 2015)\nCROSS: Sarcopenia/Muscle Mass is not a Prognostic Factor for Short- and Long-Term Outcome After Esophagectomy for Cancer (Grotenhuis et al. 2016)\n\n\nRetrospective Trimodality vs dCRT\nItaly (Castoro et al. 2013) Squamous cell 77 patients over 16 years. Comparable survival with dCRT vs Trimodality even after correcting for propensity score\nDutch(Faiz et al. 2019) Factors accounting for choice of dCRT vs Trimodality: age >75, hypertension+diabetes, CV+pulmonary.

Longer survival in trimodality group (77 vs 33 months). For those with a complete clinical response, trimodality resulted in 123 moths survival vs 55 months with dCRT. Trimodality therapy was not associated with longer overall survival but predicted recurrence-free survival.\nUK (Hategan et al. 2015) 102 patients with esophageal cancer: 55 trimodality and 47 dCRT.
