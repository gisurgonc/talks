    "text": "SEER Trends in esophageal cancer: (Corona et al. 2021) The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC = 1.60, p = 0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC = - 4.53, p &lt; 0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity.\nSEER no survival difference based upon race (Tramontano et al. 2018) T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p &lt; 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors.\nNCDB comparison of hospitals (Sridhar et al. 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Could preferential use of High Burden Hospitals by racial minorities account for their worse outcomes?\nMichigan Cancer Registry marital status at the time of diagnosis (Paniagua Cruz et al. 2020) 88.4% of our patients were White and 11.6% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9% v 31.8%, respectively; P &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment.Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes. Marital status at dx is a field in the CR Star data!!\nNCDB (Schlottmann et al. 2020) NCDB Stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. but was histology included in their model? Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. Is the negative effect on survival due to race or insurance status/geography?\n(Savitch et al. 2021) NCDB stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015 matched cohorts White:Black. 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. Did this study account for histology? What about SES?\nSmae study, different journal: (Revels et al. 2013) NCDB 2004-2015 Stage I-III esophageal cancer. Matched patient cohorts were created to reduce confounding. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receipt of surgery.

Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both).

Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival. **Another way of studying access to surgical care - this time at the facility level. Further su*pport for the theme that access to surgery is barrier to optimal esophageal cancer care.**\n(Erhunmwunsee et al. 2017) NCDB stage I-III 2003-2011. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black.

After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. Did study include histology in their model?\n(Okereke et al. 2021) NCDB 2004-2017: 127,098 patients. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery).\n(Sridhar et al. 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities.

HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). Conclusions: There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH.\nCalifornia Cancer Registry (Tran et al. 2017) Esophageal cancer cases 2004-2010. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Sounds like receipt of surgery remains disparate based upon race and accounts for some differences in outcome"

    "text": "Disparities in access to surgical care\nNorth Carolina (Wong et al. 2021) compared per capita rate of surgery in 5 high-resource counties with 5 low-resource counties using is data from the Health Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database from 2016. Using the surgical rate observed in the 5 highest-ranked counties (HRCs), the expected surgical rate in the 5 lowest-ranked counties (LRCs) in North Carolina were calculated. Patients 18 years and older who underwent an inpatient general surgery procedure and patients who underwent emergency inpatient cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy, or bariatric surgery in 2016 were included. The primary outcome was the proportional surgical ratio (PSR), which was the disparity in surgical access defined as the observed number of surgical procedures in the 5 LRCs relative to the expected number of procedures using the 5 HRCs as the standardized reference population. In 2016, approximately 1.9 million adults lived in the 5 HRCs, while approximately 246 854 lived in the 5 LRCs. A total of 28 924 inpatient general surgical procedures were performed, with 4521 being performed in those living in the 5 LRCs and 24 403 in those living in the 5 HRCs. The rate of general surgery in the 5 HRCs was 13.09 procedures per 1000 population. Using the 5 HRCs as the reference, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.35-1.44). For emergent/urgent cholecystectomy, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 2.26 (95% CI, 2.02-2.51), and the PSR for emergent/urgent herniorrhaphy was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.33-2.45). Age-adjusted rate of obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] greater than 30), on average, was 36.6% (SD, 3.4) in the 5 LRCs vs 25.4% (SD, 4.6) in the 5 HRCs (P = .002). The rate of bariatric surgery in the 5 HRCs was 33.07 per 10 000 population with obesity. For the 5 LRCs, the PSR was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.51-0.69). Could we use this same database for esophagectomy? Need to figure out whether patients that have surgery in an read different from where they live are scored as their county of residence or county where surgery was done\n(degajer276?)\n\nBody composition and Racial/Ethnic differences\nAge - Sex - Race body composition standard Curves(Magudia et al. 2021)\n\nBackground Although CT-based body composition (BC) metrics may inform disease risk and outcomes, obtaining these metrics has been too resource intensive for large-scale use. Thus, population-wide distributions of BC remain uncertain. Purpose To demonstrate the validity of fully automated, deep learning BC analysis from abdominal CT examinations, to define demographically adjusted BC reference curves, and to illustrate the advantage of use of these curves compared with standard methods, along with their biologic significance in predicting survival. Materials and Methods After external validation and equivalency testing with manual segmentation, a fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was applied to a cross-sectional population cohort that included any outpatient without a cardiovascular disease or cancer who underwent abdominal CT examination at one of three hospitals in 2012. Demographically adjusted population reference curves were generated for each BC area. The z scores derived from these curves were compared with sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia by using χ2 tests and used to predict 2-year survival in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included weight and body mass index (BMI). Results External validation showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99) and equivalency (P &lt; .001) of the fully automated deep learning BC analysis method with manual segmentation. With use of the fully automated BC data from 12 128 outpatients (mean age, 52 years; 6936 [57%] women), age-, race-, and sex-normalized BC reference curves were generated. All BC areas varied significantly with these variables (P &lt; .001 except for subcutaneous fat area vs age [P = .003]). Sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia demonstrated that age and race bias were not present if z scores derived from the reference curves were used (P &lt; .001). Skeletal muscle area z scores were significantly predictive of 2-year survival (P = .04) in combined models that included BMI. Conclusion Fully automated body composition (BC) metrics vary significantly by age, race, and sex. The z scores derived from reference curves for BC parameters better capture the demographic distribution of BC compared with standard methods and can help predict survival. Investigators at the University of Illinois {Jang et al. (2020)} examined the change in skeletal muscle index during cancer treatment among 212 patients. Among 132 non-Hispanic Black patients, muscle loss during therapy was greater than non-Hispanic White and Other (Asian + Hispanic) (Odds Ratio 3.29 p=0.004). The loss was highest in Black rectal cancer patients (11 units of SMI loss cm2/m2) vs White rectal Cancer (8 cm2/m2). Loss among colon cancer patients was higher in Black patients ( 5.5 cm2/m2) than in White patients (2.5 cm2/m2). Prior to treatment, Blacks had higher SMI than White (similar to findings of Xaio 2019)\n\nData from Kaiser (xaio615?) examined 3263 patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer. Black patients had higher lower rates of sarcopenia according to the definition of Prado et al. Patients with higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio had higher risk of muscle abnormality. CT scan at L3 was analyed to determine SMI,IMAT,VAT,SAT and TAT (=VAT+SAT+IMAT) using SliceOMatic. Threshold values determined for optimal stratification (cf (martin153?) (prado639?)\n\n\nBody composition in Colorectal cancer\nMuscle radiodensity and mortality in patients with colorectal cancer (Kroenke et al. 2018)\nFrench investigators studied 51 patients with mCRC and found sarcopenia in 70% (39% of women and 82% of men). In multivariate analysis including age, sex, BMI, sarcopenia, SAT, and VAT, the only factor associated with Grade 3-4 toxicities was sarcopenia (odds ratio = 13.55; 95% confidence interval [1.08; 169.31], P = 0.043).{(barrett_Nutritionand?)

(Feliciano et al. 2017)\nPMID 24122750\nPMID 24866483\nLow muscle mass has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis cancer patients.(Martin et al. 2013) This may be due to overal frailty or low muscle mass may lead to increased toxicity from chemotherapy due to pharmacokinetic mechanism. 5-FU is hydrophilic and it volume of distribution includes the muscle compartment, while oxaliplatin is hydrophobic, with distribution in the fat compartment(Bozzetti 2017).\nIn addition, loss of muscle mass during chemotherapy for advanced cancers is a poor prognosticator.\nBlauhoff (Blauwhoff-Buskermolen et al. 2016) studis 67 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Muscle area on CT decreased by 6.1% over 3 months. Patients in the lowest tertile (loss of 9%) had worse survial. Overall survival 17.5 months for first-line chemotherapy and 8.5months for second-line. Baseline muscle density was predictive of survival on multivariable analysis, but low SMI at baseline was not associatesd with survival. (This may be because sarcopenic obesity is the major risk factor, and there were few obese patients in the study cohort) &gt;Muscle loss of 9% or more remained independently associated with survival when adjusted for sex, age, baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, comorbidity, mono-organ or multiorgan metastases, treatment line, and tumor progression at first evaluation by computed tomography scan (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.21 to 9.05; P , .001). We found a mean coefficient of variation between observers of 0.6% for skeletal muscle area in a random sample of 20 patients, which is regarded to be low.(MacDonald, Greig, and Baracos 2011). Changes between the first and second scans were calculated as a rate of change per 3 months, meaning change per first evaluation, to compare with available literature.[awad74][prado1583]Relative muscle change per 3 months was categorized into tertiles of muscle change: tertile one, highest muscle loss up to 9%; tertile two, muscle loss of 9% to 1.5%; and tertile three, muscle loss of 1.5% until highest gain in muscle. However, the survival curve of tertile two was not significantly different from the survival curve of tertile three (log-rank P = .961); therefore tertiles two and three were pooled (cutoff, 9% muscle loss).\nAwad (Awad et al. 2012)studies changes in body composition during neodjuvant chemotherapy for esophagogastric cancer.\nKurk (Kurk et al. 2020) found that skeletal muscle loss during chemotherapy was associated with decreased progression-free and overall- survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nDetailed changes in skeletal muscle mass and body weight during CAIRO3 treatments were previously reported.KurkS, p909, 2018) We additionally analyzed changes in SMI and BMI during these treatments by linear mixed effects models.(Bayar MA,p311,2017) The baseline value of the outcome (SMI/BMI) was included in the outcome vector. Potential confounders were age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, best response to initial six cycles CAPOX‐B, resection of the primary tumor, and the number of metastatic sites. The final model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and included: treatment arm, time, age, sex, resection primary tumor, and the interaction of treatment arm by time as fixed effects. Modeling time as a random effect did not increase the model fit as indicated by the AIC. To investigate differences in SMI and BMI changes over time between the CAIRO3 treatment arms, we checked the significance of the two‐way interaction including treatment arm by time.\n\n\nDuring p2 (maintenance CAP‐B/observation), again absolute SMI and BMI at the start (t1) of treatment were not associated with early progression and death. In contrast, SMI loss and BMI loss during treatment were associated with early progression and death.\n\nFogelman (Fogelman et al. 2014) treated patients undergoing chemotherapy with a novel agent designed to reduce muscle less. CT scans at 2 months were compared with baseline scans prior to chemotherapy.\n\nChanges in skeletal muscle were determined using routinely acquired CT scans for patients on the study. We calculated skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). A single slice at the mid-point of L3 was used, preferably a 2.5-mm slice if available, and a 5-mm slice if a 2.5-mm slice was not available. The L3 is a landmark that has been extensively used and validated in studies assessing body composition in cancer patients [Shen et al. (2004)](C. M. M. Prado, Birdsell, and Baracos 2009) . Skeletal muscle surface areas were determined using Slice-o-Matic softwareTM, version 4.3 (Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada) using pre-established thresholds of Hounsfield units (HU) of −29 to +150 (Mitsiopoulos et al. 1998). We additionally evaluated adipose tissue cross-sectional area (subcutaneous, visceral, and intramuscular) in the L3 region as described previously (Mourtzakis et al. 2008). Changes in muscle and adipose tissue surface areas over time were determined for each patient from the baseline study to the first CT post treatment, done after 2 months. We looked at muscle loss as a continuous variable and defined “meaningful loss” as greater than a 6 cm2 difference from the baseline to the second scan. We chose this cut point as it is equivalent to 1 kg of skeletal muscle and is associated with physical function (i.e., muscle strength). Additionally, this cut point has been used to investigate significant changes in muscle mass throughout cancer disease trajectory [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al. 1988)(C. M. Prado et al. 2013).\n\nPrado (C. M. Prado et al. 2013) looked at changes in 1279 CT scans in 368 patients with advanced cancer. The last available interval with CT scans was chosen for comparison. Categorized into stable, gaining, losing for muscle and for adipose tissue. Adipose tissue was ?? sum of visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous tissue. (Did not use SMI). Muscel loss and adipose loss seemed correlated, with larger magnitude of adipose tissue loss at short interval to death. (Authors conclusion that muscle and adipose tissue loss in the past 3 months of life is likely not possible) &gt;Advanced-cancer patients (n = 368; median survival: 196 d) had a total of 1279 CT images over the course of their disease. With consideration of all time points, muscle loss occurred in 39% of intervals between any 2 scans. However, the overall frequency of muscle gain was 15.4%, and muscle was stable in 45.6% of intervals between any 2 scans, which made the maintenance or gain of muscle the predominant behavior. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that being within 90 d (compared with &gt;90 d) from death was the principal risk factor for muscle loss (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.94; P = 0.002), and muscle gain was correspondingly less likely (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.69; P = 0.002) at this time. Sex, age, BMI, and tumor group were not significant predictors of muscle loss or gain. A much higher proportion of men (61%) than women (31%) met the criteria for sarcopenia. Changes in muscle and adipose tissue over time were calculated as the absolute loss or gain of tissue area during each scan interval. The precision error of measurements was ~1.5% (Mourtzakis et al. 2008) with a minimum detectable change of ~3 cm2. We attributed the change during each interval into the following categories: 1) muscle loss ≥6.0 cm2, 2) stable muscle ±5.9 cm2, or 3) muscle gain ≥6.0cm2. These cutoffs are equivalent to a loss or gain of ≥1 kg of skeletal muscle on a whole-body basis and are associated with alterations in muscle strength [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al. 1988). For adipose tissue, categories were based on the equivalence of 14.7 cm2 total fat at L3 and 1 kg tissue on a whole-body basis (Shen et al. 2004); therefore, changes during each interval were categorized as 1) adipose tissue loss ≥14.7 cm2, 2) stable adipose tissue ±14.6 cm2, or 3) adipose tissue gain ≥14.7 cm2. CT scans were taken for the diagnosis, confirmation of stage, and follow-up of disease progression and treatment. With the understanding that cachexia evolves markedly in the end of life and to take advantage of repeated measures, we focused on patients with ≥2 CT images (2–6 images) on record during the year preceding their deaths (n = 368). A selection bias was not apparent in this sample; we showed that the sex distribution, age at death, survival time, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, and body-composition features (ie, muscle and adipose tissues) in patients who had only a single scan were not different from those of the overall cohort at an equal time to death (P &gt; 0.1). Patients included in the analysis (n = 368) were of advanced stage, and the median time to death of all groups was &lt;1 y.\nSimilar study by Tan looking at longitudinal body composition in pancreatic cancer (Tan et al. 2009). 111 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer: 44 identified with more than one scan. Patients who underwent repeated CT scans were more likely to receive active therapy (71%) and had longer survival than those who had a solitary CT scan (28% receiving active chemotherapy). OVeral median survival 130 days. Age and sarcopenic obesity predicted survival. Sarcopenic obesity had survival of 55 days vs 148 days for those without sarcopenia obesity. Muscle loss was normalized to percent during 100 days. Median interval between scans was ??135 days. Patients grouped in tertiles for muscle gain/loss. Top tertile gained 7% muscle cross-sectional area/100 days, while bottom tertile lost 12% over 100 days. All tertiles lost adipose tissue. No difference in survival between the tertiles. &gt; muscle loss was the prevalent behavior, but 14% of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (considered the disease most highly associated with cachexia) exhibited a muscle gain of 7.9 ± 14.4%/100 d).\nLieffers and advanced colorectal cancer: Found liver and spleen increased in size in terminal patients (causing increase in basal metabolic rate). Found more rapid muscle loss with progressive disease (Lieffers et al. 2009). Different thresholds for VAT (-150 to -50) and SAT(-190 to -30). Also estimated muscel surface area using measurements 5cm above L4(Shen et al. 2004). Most rapid change in body composition between 4 months and 1 month prior to death. &gt;14% of patients gained skeletal muscle during the year preceding death from colorectal cancer (+4.7 ± 5.4%/100 d).\nLongitudinal study of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (all with &lt;1yr survival). (Baracos et al. 2010) &gt;At referral (median time to death: 265 d), mean body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) was 24.9, with 47.4% of patients being overweight or obese. Only 7.5% overall were underweight as conventionally understood (BMI &lt; 18.5). Analysis of computed tomography images showed extremely high heterogeneity of muscle mass within all strata of BMI. The overall prevalence of severe muscle depletion (sarcopenia) was 46.8% and was present in patients in all BMI categories.\nCaan (Caan et al. 2017) examined body composition and survival from colorecal cncer at Kaiser.\n\n\nBody composition and gastric cancer\nPMID 34774016"

    "text": "Cancer cachexia is characterized by significant weight loss and muscle wasting. It is often accompanied by weakness, fatigue, and a loss of appetite. Cancer cachexia is a complex and multifactorial syndrome that is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including the cancer itself, the cancer treatment, and the body’s response to the cancer. Cancer cachexia can have a significant impact on a person’s quality of life and is associated with a poor prognosis.\nInternational consensus (Fearon et al., 2011) defined cancer cachexia as being characterized by a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass,with or without loss of adipose mass. This cachexia cannotbe fully supported by conventional nutritional support and gradually leads to functional impairment. It has been described as a continuum with three stages of diagnosis: pre‐cachexia, cachexia, and refractory cachexia.\nFearon: Three-factor model with weight loss &gt;10%, low food intake (&lt;1500kcal/day) and systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein &gt;10mg/l) (fearon?). All three factors required.\nValidation of cachexia definition: (Blum et al., 2014). Proposed a four-group classification model, which required use of CRP. PS-SGA and Edmonton Symptom Assessment System. Four group classification did not distinguish better than two group.\nReview: Cachexia and sarcopenia (Dolly et al., 2020)\nCachexia Score (CASCO): body weight and lean body mass loss; anorexia; infmallation, immunologic and metabolic disturbances; physical performance and quality of life\n\n\n\nThe cancer itself: Some types of cancer, such as pancreatic cancer, are more likely to cause cachexia than others. The presence of certain types of cancer cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages, may also contribute to the development of cachexia.\nThe body’s response to the cancer: The body’s immune system may produce certain hormones and cytokines in response to the cancer, which can lead to inflammation and weight loss.\nCancer treatment: Some cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can cause side effects that lead to weight loss and muscle wasting.\nNutritional factors: People with cancer may have difficulty getting enough nutrients due to a lack of appetite, difficulty swallowing, or other factors.\nPsychological factors: Depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions that are common in people with cancer may contribute to weight loss and muscle wasting, particularly through inactivity"

    "text": "Sarcopenia Methods Sarcopenia in GI Cancers Sarcopenia in Chemotherapy Esophageal Cancer Therapy\nThe patient with esophageal cancer faces multiple challenges in changes in body composition related to both muscle mass and adipose tissue. Patients frequently present with loss of adipose tissue and muscle from dysphaghia due to the primary tumor. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation can improve oral intake due to tumor shrinkage, but can also decrease oral nutrition due to esophagitis and the catabolic effects of cytotoxic therapy.  In addition, patients undergoing esophagectomy frequently lose weight due to limited oral intake and the catabolic effects of the stress of surgery.\nFor patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy, the chemoradiation treatment prior to surgery can be seen as a ‘stress test’ which can further assist in evaluating a patient’s resilience to the stress of surgery.\nThe coexistence of sarcopenia and obesity has led to the identification of a syndrome of sarcopenia obesity, defined as sarcopenia in the context of a BMI &gt;30kg/m^2. These patients suffer the consequences of both loss of muscle mass with excess adipose tissue, which appear to act synergistically to decrease survival in cancer patients.(Prado et al. 2008) (Martin et al. 2013)\n\n\n\n\nA Japanese group of 190 patients undergoing esophagectomy were studied. Sarcopenia was found in 149 (75%).(Nishigori et al. 2016). Sarcopenia definition of Prado. Among sarcopenic patients, pneumonia occurred in 44 (29%) vs 5 (10%) among patients without sarcopenia.\nAnother group(Ida et al. 2015) found similar association between sarcopenia and pulmonary complications after esophagectomy.\nA Japanese study examined the predictive value of sarcopenia relative to anastomotic leak after esophagectomy(Tamandl et al. 2016). While sarcopenia in patients under age 65 was not associated with adverse outcomes, among 166 patients over age 65, sarcopenia was associated with increased risk of anastomotic leak and in-hospital mortality. Sarcopenia was defined: SMI of ≤ 39cm2/m2 for women and ≤ 55cm2/m2 for men\nAmong 98 Japanese patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, 31 (31%) were found to be sarcopenic. Sarcopenia defined by appendicular skeletal mass and grip strength &lt;26kg(men) and &lt;18kg(women). Among these patients the 90-day readmission rate was 42.9% vs 16% in those without sarcopenia(Makiura et al. 2018). In addition, sarcopenia was associated with overall survival after adjusting for age, gender, and pathologic stage.\nIrish study (Elliott et al. 2017)\nMeta-analysis of 8 studies (Schizas et al. 2020)\n\n\n\nCROSS: 120 patients from CROSS trial who underwent chemoRT followed by surgery.

Median survival was longer in patients without sarcopenia (52months) compared with those with sarcopenia (21 months).{Paireder, 2017 #2003}(Paireder et al. 2017)\nA Japanese study examined the predictive value of sarcopenia relative to anastomotic leak and overall survival after esophagectomy {Tamandl, 2016 #2006}. While sarcopenia in patients under age 65 was not associated with adverse outcomes, among 166 patients over age 65, sarcopenia was associated with decreased overall survival.\nAmong 98 Japanese patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer, 31 (31%) were found to be sarcopenic. Among these patients.{Makiura, 2018 #2007} sarcopenia was associated with overall survival after adjusting for age, gender, and pathologic stage.\nSlovenia: (Srpcic et al. 2020) 139 patients esophagectomy for cancer. SMI in men at less than 43.1 cm2/m2and less than 32.7 cm2/ m2 in women. Cutoff values for myosteatosis from the same study were used with myosteatosis defined as MA of less than 30.9 HU in men and 24.8 HU in women(Werf et al. 2018). Prevalence of sarcopenia and myosteatosis at presentation was 16.5% and 51.8%. Both were associated with decreased OS. Median survival was 18.3 months (CI 5.4-31.1) vs 31.0 months (CI 7.4-54.6) for sarcopenia/no sarcopenia (log rank p = 0.042) and 19.0 months (CI 13.3-24.7) vs 57.1 months (CI 15.2-99.0) for myosteatosis (log rank p = 0.044), respectively. A relationship between sarcopenia and myosteatosis and other negative outcomes after esophagectomy could not be established.\nTokyo 102 patients undergoing esophagectomy @somadoy092. Mean age = 67. Sarcopenia associated with higher rate of respiratory complications (44% vs. 10.5%; P &lt; 0.001). Length of Stay (P = 0.0088) and ICU stay (P = 0.011) were longer with sarcopenia and risk of pulmonary complications higher (odds ratio = 5.86).\nA meta-analysis of 4 studies totaling 649 patients showed that sarcopenia was associated with a survival hazard ratio of 1.5 compared with non-sarcopenia patients {Shachar, 2017 #2122}.\nMeta-analysis of 11 studies found that sarcopenia was associated with decreased survival after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer (Deng et al. 2019)\nSarcopenia and survival and unplanned admissions after esophagectomy (Makiura et al. 2018)\nSarcopenia and postop pulmonary complications after esophagectomy (Makiura et al. 2016)\nEsophageal cancer 341 patients, of whom 170 over age 65 (Nakashima et al. 2018).

Investigators in the UK noted similar changes in muscle mass among 14 patients as a result of neoadjuvant chemotherapy{Awad, 2012 #1990}. Neither study showed differences between loss of muscle mass and length of stay or survival, although neither study included a power analysis of these outcomes. A larger study from the Netherlands (n=123) {Reisinger, 2015 #1993} showed no association between muscle mass loss in mortality in the overall group, but did find a significant difference in mortality in 62 patients with stage III or IV disease.\nAmong 123 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation,the loss of muscle mass during chemoradiation (as measured by skeletal muscle CSA) was predictive of postoperative mortality {Reisinger, #1993}. Muscle loss was 13.5% in patients with complication-related mortality, and 8% in those without.\nMiyata H, Sugimura K, Motoori M, Fujiwara Y, Omori T, Yanagimoto Y, Ohue M, Yasui M, Miyoshi N, Tomokuni A, et al. Clinical assessment of sarcopenia and changes in body composition during neoadjuvant therapy for esophageal cancer (Miyata et al. 2017)"

Domain-specific cutoffs were used in accordance with prior literature.21, 23-25 Frailty was reported using the CARE Frailty Index based on the principles of deficit accumulation, as previously published.26, 27 In brief, the CARE Frailty Index includes 44 geriatric assessment variables identified as health deficits from the CARE survey, each of which is scored as 0 (no deficit) or 1 (deficit present) (see Supporting Methods). These values were then combined and divided by the overall number of deficits assessed (range, 0-1) and categorized as robust (0-0.2), prefrail (0.2-0.35), and frail (&gt;0.35).26 In addition, the CARE survey incorporates the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 10-item global health questionnaire to assess HRQoL, which includes physical and mental health subscales.28, 29\nPrognostic scales for cancer: France: (Canoui-Poitrine et al. 2022) 510 patients with cancer evaluated with multiple prognostic scales including CCI and Elixhauser.

In multivariate analysis including age, sex, BMI, sarcopenia, SAT, and VAT, the only factor associated with Grade 3-4 toxicities was sarcopenia (odds ratio = 13.55; 95% confidence interval [1.08; 169.31], P = 0.043).(barrett583?)\nData from Kaiser (Xiao et al., 2019) examined 3263 patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer.

CT scan at L3 was analyed to determine SMI,IMAT,VAT,SAT and TAT (=VAT+SAT+IMAT) using SliceOMatic. Threshold values determined for optimal stratification (cf (Martin et al., 2013; prado639?)\nLow muscle mass has been shown to be associated with poor prognosis cancer patients.(Martin et al., 2013) This may be due to overal frailty or low muscle mass may lead to increased toxicity from chemotherapy due to pharmacokinetic mechanism. 5-FU is hydrophilic and it volume of distribution includes the muscle compartment, while oxaliplatin is hydrophobic, with distribution in the fat compartment(Bozzetti, 2017).\nIn addition, loss of muscle mass during chemotherapy for advanced cancers is a poor prognosticator.\nBlauhoff (Blauwhoff-Buskermolen et al., 2016) studis 67 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Muscle area on CT decreased by 6.1% over 3 months. Patients in the lowest tertile (loss of 9%) had worse survial. Overall survival 17.5 months for first-line chemotherapy and 8.5months for second-line. Baseline muscle density was predictive of survival on multivariable analysis, but low SMI at baseline was not associatesd with survival. (This may be because sarcopenic obesity is the major risk factor, and there were few obese patients in the study cohort) &gt;Muscle loss of 9% or more remained independently associated with survival when adjusted for sex, age, baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, comorbidity, mono-organ or multiorgan metastases, treatment line, and tumor progression at first evaluation by computed tomography scan (hazard ratio, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.21 to 9.05; P , .001). We found a mean coefficient of variation between observers of 0.6% for skeletal muscle area in a random sample of 20 patients, which is regarded to be low.(MacDonald et al., 2011). Changes between the first and second scans were calculated as a rate of change per 3 months, meaning change per first evaluation, to compare with available literature.[awad74][prado1583]Relative muscle change per 3 months was categorized into tertiles of muscle change: tertile one, highest muscle loss up to 9%; tertile two, muscle loss of 9% to 1.5%; and tertile three, muscle loss of 1.5% until highest gain in muscle. However, the survival curve of tertile two was not significantly different from the survival curve of tertile three (log-rank P = .961); therefore tertiles two and three were pooled (cutoff, 9% muscle loss).\nKurk (Kurk et al., 2020) found that skeletal muscle loss during chemotherapy was associated with decreased progression-free and overall- survival in metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\nDetailed changes in skeletal muscle mass and body weight during CAIRO3 treatments were previously reported.KurkS, p909, 2018) We additionally analyzed changes in SMI and BMI during these treatments by linear mixed effects models.(Bayar MA,p311,2017) The baseline value of the outcome (SMI/BMI) was included in the outcome vector. Potential confounders were age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, best response to initial six cycles CAPOX‐B, resection of the primary tumor, and the number of metastatic sites. The final model was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and included: treatment arm, time, age, sex, resection primary tumor, and the interaction of treatment arm by time as fixed effects. Modeling time as a random effect did not increase the model fit as indicated by the AIC. To investigate differences in SMI and BMI changes over time between the CAIRO3 treatment arms, we checked the significance of the two‐way interaction including treatment arm by time.\n\n\nDuring p2 (maintenance CAP‐B/observation), again absolute SMI and BMI at the start (t1) of treatment were not associated with early progression and death. In contrast, SMI loss and BMI loss during treatment were associated with early progression and death.\n\nFogelman (Fogelman et al., 2014) treated patients undergoing chemotherapy with a novel agent designed to reduce muscle less. CT scans at 2 months were compared with baseline scans prior to chemotherapy.\n\nChanges in skeletal muscle were determined using routinely acquired CT scans for patients on the study. We calculated skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). A single slice at the mid-point of L3 was used, preferably a 2.5-mm slice if available, and a 5-mm slice if a 2.5-mm slice was not available. The L3 is a landmark that has been extensively used and validated in studies assessing body composition in cancer patients [Shen et al. (2004)](Prado et al., 2009) . Skeletal muscle surface areas were determined using Slice-o-Matic softwareTM, version 4.3 (Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada) using pre-established thresholds of Hounsfield units (HU) of −29 to +150 (Mitsiopoulos et al., 1998). We additionally evaluated adipose tissue cross-sectional area (subcutaneous, visceral, and intramuscular) in the L3 region as described previously (Mourtzakis et al., 2008). Changes in muscle and adipose tissue surface areas over time were determined for each patient from the baseline study to the first CT post treatment, done after 2 months. We looked at muscle loss as a continuous variable and defined “meaningful loss” as greater than a 6 cm2 difference from the baseline to the second scan. We chose this cut point as it is equivalent to 1 kg of skeletal muscle and is associated with physical function (i.e., muscle strength). Additionally, this cut point has been used to investigate significant changes in muscle mass throughout cancer disease trajectory [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al., 1988)(Prado et al., 2013).\n\nPrado (Prado et al., 2013) looked at changes in 1279 CT scans in 368 patients with advanced cancer. The last available interval with CT scans was chosen for comparison. Categorized into stable, gaining, losing for muscle and for adipose tissue. Adipose tissue was ?? sum of visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous tissue. (Did not use SMI). Muscel loss and adipose loss seemed correlated, with larger magnitude of adipose tissue loss at short interval to death. (Authors conclusion that muscle and adipose tissue loss in the past 3 months of life is likely not possible) &gt;Advanced-cancer patients (n = 368; median survival: 196 d) had a total of 1279 CT images over the course of their disease. With consideration of all time points, muscle loss occurred in 39% of intervals between any 2 scans. However, the overall frequency of muscle gain was 15.4%, and muscle was stable in 45.6% of intervals between any 2 scans, which made the maintenance or gain of muscle the predominant behavior. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that being within 90 d (compared with &gt;90 d) from death was the principal risk factor for muscle loss (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.94; P = 0.002), and muscle gain was correspondingly less likely (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.69; P = 0.002) at this time. Sex, age, BMI, and tumor group were not significant predictors of muscle loss or gain. A much higher proportion of men (61%) than women (31%) met the criteria for sarcopenia. Changes in muscle and adipose tissue over time were calculated as the absolute loss or gain of tissue area during each scan interval. The precision error of measurements was ~1.5% (Mourtzakis et al., 2008) with a minimum detectable change of ~3 cm2. We attributed the change during each interval into the following categories: 1) muscle loss ≥6.0 cm2, 2) stable muscle ±5.9 cm2, or 3) muscle gain ≥6.0cm2. These cutoffs are equivalent to a loss or gain of ≥1 kg of skeletal muscle on a whole-body basis and are associated with alterations in muscle strength [Shen et al. (2004)](Frontera et al., 1988). For adipose tissue, categories were based on the equivalence of 14.7 cm2 total fat at L3 and 1 kg tissue on a whole-body basis (Shen et al., 2004); therefore, changes during each interval were categorized as 1) adipose tissue loss ≥14.7 cm2, 2) stable adipose tissue ±14.6 cm2, or 3) adipose tissue gain ≥14.7 cm2. CT scans were taken for the diagnosis, confirmation of stage, and follow-up of disease progression and treatment. With the understanding that cachexia evolves markedly in the end of life and to take advantage of repeated measures, we focused on patients with ≥2 CT images (2–6 images) on record during the year preceding their deaths (n = 368). A selection bias was not apparent in this sample; we showed that the sex distribution, age at death, survival time, primary tumor site, tumor morphology, and body-composition features (ie, muscle and adipose tissues) in patients who had only a single scan were not different from those of the overall cohort at an equal time to death (P &gt; 0.1). Patients included in the analysis (n = 368) were of advanced stage, and the median time to death of all groups was &lt;1 y.\nLieffers and advanced colorectal cancer: Found liver and spleen increased in size in terminal patients (causing increase in basal metabolic rate). Found more rapid muscle loss with progressive disease (Lieffers et al., 2009). Different thresholds for VAT (-150 to -50) and SAT(-190 to -30). Also estimated muscel surface area using measurements 5cm above L4(Shen et al., 2004). Most rapid change in body composition between 4 months and 1 month prior to death. &gt;14% of patients gained skeletal muscle during the year preceding death from colorectal cancer (+4.7 ± 5.4%/100 d)."

Skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (MSA) is most commonly measured at the L3 level using image analysis software to identify all tissue between -29 and 150 Hounsfield Units {Martin, 2013 #1965}.\nA less common, but faster method is the extrapolation of muscle mass from the psoas diameter {Peng, 2011 #1946;Jones, 2015 #1959}, but some comparative studies have questioned the predictive ability of psoas diameter {Rutten, 2017 #1979;Martin, 2013 #1965;Ebadi,  #1982} as a substitute for muscle cross-sectional area.\nCross-sectional muscle area is frequently normalized to body height to calculate the Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI).\n\n\nSarcopenia definition using SMI cutoffs stratified by sex: 52.4 cm2 /m2 for men and 38.5 cm 2 /m2 for women (Prado et al., 2008)\nSMI cutoffs stratified by sex and BMI: defined as &lt;43 cm2/m2 in men with a BMI &lt;24.9 kg/m2, &lt;53 cm2/m2 in men with a BMI &gt;25 kg/m2, and &lt;41 cm2/m2 in women of any BMI (Martin et al., 2013) J\nPercentiles for SMI and density from healthy Caucasian kidney donors.

The density of muscle mass on cross-sectional imaging has been used to estimate the Skeletal Muscle Density (SMD), which represents fatty infiltration of the muscle, which is based upon the differential density of fat and muscle on CT imaging.\nVisceral adipose tissue (VAT) can be measured in similar fashion to skeletal muscle, using analysis of axial CT images.\nPublished literature quotes an interobserver coefficient of variation of 1.5% {Prado, 2008 #1848}\nIV Contrast Tube current - (Fuchs et al., 2018) Slice Thickness (Morsbach et al., 2019) Contrasst challenges (Bae, 2010) Muscle L4 contrast (Boutin et al., 2016) IV contrast and muscle size (Anne van der Werf et al., 2018) (Vugt et al., 2018) kV(morsbach9?)\nICC 24/35/42 (Fuchs et al., 2018) (Anne van der Werf et al., 2018) (Barnard et al., 2019) (Perthen et al., 2018)\nMachine learning 43-46 (Jang et al., 2019) ML methods from Lung Cancer Screening Trial.

The challenge with this approach is the relatively small dispersion of Hounsfield Units.\nAn alternative is to subdivide skeletal muscle area into high density and low density areas. One method is to distinguish normal attenuation muscle area (NAMA) from low attenuation muscle area (LAMA). This was initially described by investigators from Japan (Kim et al., 2021). The same grouop measured IMAT within the muscle envelope using fat thresholds. See also\nAn alternative (experimental) approach would be assume that a density histogram of the muscle area is a gaussian mixture of two peaks - one for muscle and one for adipose tissue, and to use a mathematical tool such as the mixtools R package to resolve the density histogram into two peaks.\nPapers using gaussian mixture for segmentation:\nAn automated and robust framework for quantification of muscle and fat in the thigh (Tan et al., 2014)\nJ. de Carvalho Felinto et al., “Automatic segmentation and quantification of thigh tissues in CT images,” in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), 2018, vol. 10960 LNCS, pp. 261–276, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-95162-1_18.\nGMM for liver segmentation(dunj5654424?)\nJohnson SB Mixture model see ForestFit R package\n\nMyosteatosis\nMeta-analysis of 40 studies: overall prevalence of 48% among cancer patients, with HR of 1.75 for mortality.

    "text": "(Bliton et al., 2021) NCDB observed Black-White difference in receipt of surgery persists on multivariable adjustment via GLM with adjusted ORs of 0.87 (050–0.64) for esophagus, 0.53 (0.48–0.57) for DEGC. Adjusted for patient factors including histology. Receipt of surgery was strongly associated with survival.\nSEER Trends in esophageal cancer: (Corona et al., 2021) The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC = 1.60, p = 0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC = - 4.53, p &lt; 0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity.\nSEER no survival difference based upon race (Tramontano et al., 2018) T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p &lt; 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors.\nNCDB comparison of hospitals (Sridhar et al., 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Could preferential use of High Burden Hospitals by racial minorities account for their worse outcomes?\nMichigan Cancer Registry marital status at the time of diagnosis (Paniagua Cruz et al., 2020) 88.4% of our patients were White and 11.6% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9% v 31.8%, respectively; P &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment.Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes. Marital status at dx is a field in the CR Star data!!\nNCDB (Schlottmann et al., 2020) NCDB Stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. but was histology included in their model? Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. Is the negative effect on survival due to race or insurance status/geography?\nNCDB stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015 (Savitch et al., 2021) matched cohorts White:Black. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization. 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival. Another way of studying access to surgical care - this time at the facility level. Further support for the theme that access to surgery is barrier to optimal esophageal cancer care. Did this study account for histology? What about SES?\n(Swords et al., 2020) NCDB 2003-2011 Stage I-III esophageal cancer. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, *SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not.**\n(Erhunmwunsee et al., 2017) NCDB stage I-III 2003-2011. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. Did study include histology in their model?\n(Okereke et al., 2021) NCDB 2004-2017: 127,098 patients. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery). Surgery less often in Black patients but no correction for histology.\nCalifornia Cancer Registry (Tran et al., 2017) Esophageal cancer cases 2004-2010. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Sounds like receipt of surgery remains disparate based upon race and accounts for some differences in outcome\n\n\n\nAmong 565 124 adult patients who underwent surgical resection of a gastrointestinal tract cancer, 10.9% were Black patients, 83.5% were White patients, Longer median survival was associated with negative resection margins (87.3 [IQR, 28.5-161.9] months vs 22.9 [IQR, 8.8-69.2] months; P &lt; .001) and adequate lymphadenectomies (80.7 [IQR, 25.6 to not reached] months vs 57.6 [IQR, 17.7-153.8] months; P &lt; .001). After adjustment for covariates, Black patients were less likely than White patients to have negative surgical margins after esophagectomy (OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.58-0.87]), Black patients were also less likely to have adequate lymphadenectomy after esophagectomy (OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.63-0.83]), Black patients were more likely than White patients not to be recommended for chemotherapy (OR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.10-1.21]) and radiotherapy (OR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.35-1.64]) because of comorbidities and more likely not to receive recommended chemotherapy (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.551.82]) and radiotherapy (OR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.97-2.41]) for unknown reasons. (Bakkila et al., 2022)\n\n\n\n(Greenstein et al., 2008) SEER:  1522 patients were included in the study. Blacks had worse esophageal-specific survival rates than whites (37% vs 60% 5-year survival; P &lt; .0001). Blacks were more likely to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage and to have squamous cell tumors, but were less likely to undergo surgery. In multivariate regression controlling for age, sex, marital status, histology, and tumor location, black race was associated with worse survival. When tumor status, surgery, and radiotherapy were added to the model, race was no longer significantly associated with survival.\n(dong257?) SEER-Medicare Matched patients with esophageal cancer. The absolute difference in 5-year survival between black patients (13.3%) and NHW patients (18.4%) was 5.1% (95% CI, 2.3%-7.7%; P = .001) in the demographics match. After we matched for presentation, the difference in 5-year survival was reduced to 2.3% (95% CI, 0.3%-4.8%), but remained statistically significant (P = .04). Additional matching of patients on treatment-related factors eliminated the racial difference in 5-year survival (P = .59). Among patients matched for disease presentation, only 10.8% of black patients underwent surgery, compared with 22.8% of NHW patients (P &lt; .001). Histology, tumor location, socioeconomic status, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy each were associated with the receipt of surgery. None of these factors, however, could explain the racial difference in the receipt of surgery.\n(Al-Refaie et al., 2012) Using the 2003-2008 National Inpatient Sample, we identified 59,841 patients who underwent cancer operations for lung, esophagus, and pancreas tumors. Logistic regression models were used to examine the impact of sociodemographic factors on receipt of complex cancer surgery at LVH. Overall, 38.4% received their cancer surgery at LVH. A higher proportion of esophagectomies were performed at LVH (70.3%), followed by pancreatectomy (38.2%) and lung resection (33.8%). Patients who were non-white, with non-private insurance, and had more comorbidities were all more likely to receive their cancer surgery at LVH (for all, p &lt; 0.05). Multivariate analyses continued to demonstrate that non-white race, insurance status, increased comorbidities, region, and nonelective admission predicted receipt of cancer surgery at LVH across all 3 procedures.\nReview of social disparities in treatment of esophageal cancer (Delman et al., 2021)\n(Dimick et al., 2013) Black patients more likely to undergo surgery at low-quality hospitals\nNorth Carolina (Wong et al., 2021) compared per capita rate of surgery in 5 high-resource counties with 5 low-resource counties using is data from the Health Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database from 2016. Using the surgical rate observed in the 5 highest-ranked counties (HRCs), the expected surgical rate in the 5 lowest-ranked counties (LRCs) in North Carolina were calculated. Patients 18 years and older who underwent an inpatient general surgery procedure and patients who underwent emergency inpatient cholecystectomy, herniorrhaphy, or bariatric surgery in 2016 were included. The primary outcome was the proportional surgical ratio (PSR), which was the disparity in surgical access defined as the observed number of surgical procedures in the 5 LRCs relative to the expected number of procedures using the 5 HRCs as the standardized reference population. In 2016, approximately 1.9 million adults lived in the 5 HRCs, while approximately 246 854 lived in the 5 LRCs. A total of 28 924 inpatient general surgical procedures were performed, with 4521 being performed in those living in the 5 LRCs and 24 403 in those living in the 5 HRCs. The rate of general surgery in the 5 HRCs was 13.09 procedures per 1000 population. Using the 5 HRCs as the reference, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.35-1.44). For emergent/urgent cholecystectomy, the PSR for the 5 LRCs was 2.26 (95% CI, 2.02-2.51), and the PSR for emergent/urgent herniorrhaphy was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.33-2.45). Age-adjusted rate of obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] greater than 30), on average, was 36.6% (SD, 3.4) in the 5 LRCs vs 25.4% (SD, 4.6) in the 5 HRCs (P = .002). The rate of bariatric surgery in the 5 HRCs was 33.07 per 10 000 population with obesity. For the 5 LRCs, the PSR was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.51-0.69). Could we use this same database for esophagectomy? Need to figure out whether patients that have surgery in an read different from where they live are scored as their county of residence or county where surgery was done\n(degajer276?)\nThoracic surgeons (Alvarado et al., 2023) Black\nThe Premier Healthcare Database was used to identify adult inpatients receiving esophagectomy categorized as receiving their esophagectomy from a thoracic versus non-thoracic provider. During the study period, 960 patients met inclusion criteria representing an estimated population size of 3894 patients. Among them, 1696 (43.5%) were performed by a thoracic surgeon and 2199 (56.5%) were performed by non-thoracic providers. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with decreased likelihood of receiving care from a thoracic provider included Black (OR 0.41, p &lt; 0.001), Other (OR 0.21, p &lt; 0.001), and Unknown race (OR 0.22, p = 0.04), and uninsured patients (OR 0.53, p = 0.03). Urban hospital setting was associated with an increased likelihood of care by a thoracic provider (OR 4.43, p = 0.001).\n\n\n\nAge - Sex - Race body composition standard Curves(Magudia et al., 2021)\nBackground Although CT-based body composition (BC) metrics may inform disease risk and outcomes, obtaining these metrics has been too resource intensive for large-scale use. Thus, population-wide distributions of BC remain uncertain. Purpose To demonstrate the validity of fully automated, deep learning BC analysis from abdominal CT examinations, to define demographically adjusted BC reference curves, and to illustrate the advantage of use of these curves compared with standard methods, along with their biologic significance in predicting survival. Materials and Methods After external validation and equivalency testing with manual segmentation, a fully automated deep learning BC analysis pipeline was applied to a cross-sectional population cohort that included any outpatient without a cardiovascular disease or cancer who underwent abdominal CT examination at one of three hospitals in 2012. Demographically adjusted population reference curves were generated for each BC area. The z scores derived from these curves were compared with sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia by using χ2 tests and used to predict 2-year survival in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included weight and body mass index (BMI). Results External validation showed excellent correlation (R = 0.99) and equivalency (P &lt; .001) of the fully automated deep learning BC analysis method with manual segmentation. With use of the fully automated BC data from 12 128 outpatients (mean age, 52 years; 6936 [57%] women), age-, race-, and sex-normalized BC reference curves were generated. All BC areas varied significantly with these variables (P &lt; .001 except for subcutaneous fat area vs age [P = .003]). Sex-specific thresholds for sarcopenia demonstrated that age and race bias were not present if z scores derived from the reference curves were used (P &lt; .001). Skeletal muscle area z scores were significantly predictive of 2-year survival (P = .04) in combined models that included BMI. Conclusion Fully automated body composition (BC) metrics vary significantly by age, race, and sex. The z scores derived from reference curves for BC parameters better capture the demographic distribution of BC compared with standard methods and can help predict survival. Investigators at the University of Illinois {Jang et al. (2020)} examined the change in skeletal muscle index during cancer treatment among 212 patients. Among 132 non-Hispanic Black patients, muscle loss during therapy was greater than non-Hispanic White and Other (Asian + Hispanic) (Odds Ratio 3.29 p=0.004). The loss was highest in Black rectal cancer patients (11 units of SMI loss cm2/m2) vs White rectal Cancer (8 cm2/m2). Loss among colon cancer patients was higher in Black patients ( 5.5 cm2/m2) than in White patients (2.5 cm2/m2). Prior to treatment, Blacks had higher SMI than White (similar to findings of Xaio 2019)\nData from Kaiser (xaio615?) examined 3263 patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer. Black patients had higher lower rates of sarcopenia according to the definition of Prado et al. Patients with higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio had higher risk of muscle abnormality. CT scan at L3 was analyed to determine SMI,IMAT,VAT,SAT and TAT (=VAT+SAT+IMAT) using SliceOMatic. Threshold values determined for optimal stratification (cf (martin153?)

Hence, efforts to optimize functional capacity prior to surgery have shown improved outcomes for some abdominal and oncologic surgeries [20]. A multimodal approach termed as ‘prehabilitation’ comprising nutritional supplementation, psychological counselling, medical optimization, and a structured exercise program involving both aerobic and strengthening activity has been proposed to improve outcomes [21]. Respiratory optimization with deep breathing exercises, spirometry, and inspiratory muscle training decreases pulmonary complications [22]. Studies have shown that prehabilitation reduces anxiety, depression and fatigue, and improves the quality of life [23]. Preliminary results from a recently concluded study [24] on prehabilitation for esophageal surgery demonstrated improvement in functional capacity; however, the impact on postoperative outcomes needs to be evaluated by further ongoing studies [25]. Extrapolation from studies on other abdominal surgeries [20] suggests that at least 4 weeks of preoperative prehabilitation is better than postoperative rehabilitation to influence outcomes. As most patients with operable esophageal cancer would receive neoadjuvant treatment, it would be opportunistic to use this preoperative window to initiate prehabilitation.\nA feasibility trial of prehabilitation before oesophagogastric cancer surgery using a multi-component home-based exercise programme: the ChemoFit study.(Chmelo et al. 2022)\nThe Role of Prehabilitation in Modern Esophagogastric Cancer Surgery: A Comprehensive Review.(Bausys et al. 2022)\nPrehab (Gillis et al. 2018)"

Findings the ideal location for the tube involves laparoscopy with low insufflation pressure (4mm Hg), which allows adequate distention of the stomach with an endoscope. A neonatal (5mm) endoscope can be helpful. A site is selected at the midpoint of the stomach on a saggital plane to allow minimal tension on the tube. The tube is placed as far proximally on the stomach as possible yet still at least 3cm from the left costal margin (for patient comfort and to allow minimal tension on the gastrostomy tube).

    "text": "SEER Trends in esophageal cancer: (Corona et al. 2021) The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC = 1.60, p = 0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC = - 4.53, p &lt; 0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity.\nSEER no survival difference based upon race (Tramontano et al. 2018) T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p &lt; 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors.\nNCDB comparison of hospitals (Sridhar et al. 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Could preferential use of High Burden Hospitals by racial minorities account for their worse outcomes?\nMichigan Cancer Registry marital status at the time of diagnosis (Paniagua Cruz et al. 2020) 88.4% of our patients were White and 11.6% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9% v 31.8%, respectively; P &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment.Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes. Marital status at dx is a field in the CR Star data!!\nNCDB (Schlottmann et al. 2020) NCDB Stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. but was histology included in their model? Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. Is the negative effect on survival due to race or insurance status/geography?\n(Savitch et al. 2021) NCDB stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015 matched cohorts White:Black. 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. Did this study account for histology? What about SES?\nSmae study, different journal: (Revels et al. 2013) NCDB 2004-2015 Stage I-III esophageal cancer. Matched patient cohorts were created to reduce confounding. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with receipt of surgery. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization.Total of 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients evenly distributed across race. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. Looks identical to (Savitch et al. 2021)\n(Swords et al. 2020) NCDB 2003-2011 Stage I-III esophageal cancer. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, *SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not.**\n(Savitch et al. 2021) NCDB 2004-2015 Stage I-III esophgeal cancer. Matched patient cohorts were created to reduce confounding. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization. Total of 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients evenly distributed across race. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival. **Another way of studying access to surgical care - this time at the facility level. Further su*pport for the theme that access to surgery is barrier to optimal esophageal cancer care.**\n(Erhunmwunsee et al. 2017) NCDB stage I-III 2003-2011. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. Did study include histology in their model?\n(Okereke et al. 2021) NCDB 2004-2017: 127,098 patients. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery).\n(Sridhar et al. 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). Conclusions: There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH.\nCalifornia Cancer Registry (Tran et al. 2017) Esophageal cancer cases 2004-2010. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Sounds like receipt of surgery remains disparate based upon race and accounts for some differences in outcome"

Complete celiac axis lymphadenectomy is performed. The left gastric and short gastric vessels are divided and the gastroepiploic arcade preserved in its entirety during gastric mobilization. Near infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green may be utilized to clearly identify and preserve the gastroepiploic arcade to its termination point.\nIn the setting of previous induction chemoradiation therapy, an omental flap based off of 2–3 omental perforating arteries may be harvested for later reinforcement of the gastroesophageal anastomosis.\nComplete gastric mobilization from the hiatus to the pylorus is performed. The gastric conduit is created with sequential applications of the endogastrointestinal stapler. The conduit is secured to the specimen for later traverse into the chest in proper orientation. The omental flap, if created, should be secured to the tip of the conduit to simplify transit into the chest as well."

Eight mm robotic ports are placed at the eighth intercostal space at the posterior axillary line, the third intercostal space in the mid to posterior axillary, fifth intercostal place into the mid axillary line, and at the ninth intercostal space approximately in line with the tip of the scapula. An assistant non-robotic port is placed at the site of the diaphragmatic insertion. Complete circumferential esophageal mobilization is performed from the level of the hiatus to the azygous vein with careful attention to harvest all periesophageal lymph node bearing tissues en bloc with the specimen. During dissection of the subcarinal lymph node packet, great care must be taken to avoid energy associated thermal injury to the membranous wall of the airways. Judicious use of both bipolar energy sources and non-energy dependent sharp and blunt dissection, and clear visualization and exposure of the dependent anatomy are critical to avoid these injuries which may result in esophageal/conduit airway fistulas. Additional mobilization of the esophagus towards the thoracic inlet is completed with careful attention to avoid traction or direct injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The conduit is delivered into the chest and sutured to the diaphragm. The caudal to cranial deep dissection along the contralateral pleura and left mainstem bronchus is completed with lateral retraction of the specimen once divided from the conduit."

A 4–5 cm access incision in made through the operator’s “left” hand robotic working port to deliver the specimen out of the chest. A robotically placed running “baseball” suture is placed around the opening of the divided proximal esophagus, and the anvil of the 28 mm end to end anastomotic (EEA) stapler is inserted and secured. An additional reinforcing superficial purse string suture is placed to ensure tissue apposition around the stem of the anvil during deployment of the stapler. The EEA stapler is introduced through a gastrotomy site created in the proximal conduit tip, and the spike brought out through the lateral wall of the conduit ideally just above the level of the vascular arcade insertion. The stapler is then docked to the anvil and fired, creating the anastomosis, and the redundant conduit resected. If an omental flap has been harvested, it is loosely secured around the newly created anastomosis at this time. A drain is left posterior to the conduit and a chest tube is left in the right pleural space.\nVideo"

    "text": "(Bliton et al., 2021) NCDB observed Black-White difference in receipt of surgery persists on multivariable adjustment via GLM with adjusted ORs of 0.87 (050–0.64) for esophagus, 0.53 (0.48–0.57) for DEGC. Adjusted for patient factors including histology. Receipt of surgery was strongly associated with survival.\nSEER Trends in esophageal cancer: (Corona et al., 2021) The study included 19,257 EAC cases and 15,162 ESCC cases. EAC mortality increased significantly overall and in non-Hispanic Whites from 1993 to 2012 and from 1993 to 2010, respectively. EAC mortality continued to rise among non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) (APC = 1.60, p = 0.01). NHB experienced the fastest decline in ESCC mortality (APC = - 4.53, p &lt; 0.001) yet maintained the highest mortality at the end of the study period. Proportions of late stage disease increased overall by 18.5 and 24.5 percentage points for EAC and ESCC respectively; trends varied by race/ethnicity.\nSEER no survival difference based upon race (Tramontano et al., 2018) T1-3N0M0 adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. Among 2025 patients, 87.9% were White and 12.1% were Nonwhite. Median survival was 18.7 months for Whites vs 13.8 months for Nonwhites (p = 0.01). In the unadjusted model, Nonwhite patients had higher risk of mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49, p &lt; 0.0001) when compared to White patients; however, in the Cox regression adjusted model there was no significant difference (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.80-1.10, p = 0.44). Surgery, chemotherapy, younger age, lower T stage, and lower Charlson comorbidity score were significant predictors in the full adjusted model. Differences in mortality risk by race/ethnicity appear to be largely explained by additional factors.\nNCDB comparison of hospitals (Sridhar et al., 2019) NCDB esophageal cancer 2004-2013. Treating facilities were categorized according to their relative burden of uninsured or Medicaid-insured patients. Hospitals with low (LBH), medium (MBH), and high (HBH) safety-net burden were compared with respect to patient demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, and survival. 56,115 patients from 1,215 facilities. HBH treated a greater proportion of racial and ethnic minorities and patients with lower socioeconomic status. Patients at HBH presented at later stages and received primary surgical therapy less often than at MBH and LBH. Survival for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma did not differ significantly between HBH and LBH after adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, comorbidity, stage, histologic type, tumor location, facility type, insurance status, and treatment modality (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.14; p = 0.093). HBH were associated with a higher mortality risk than LBH for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.20; p = 0.014). There is a mortality risk for patients with squamous cell carcinoma, but not for adenocarcinoma at HBH compared with LBH. Could preferential use of High Burden Hospitals by racial minorities account for their worse outcomes?\nMichigan Cancer Registry marital status at the time of diagnosis (Paniagua Cruz et al., 2020) 88.4% of our patients were White and 11.6% were Black. A significantly higher number of White patients were married when compared with Blacks (62.9% v 31.8%, respectively; P &lt; .0001). There was no significant difference in cancer staging between the 2 groups (P = .0671). Married Blacks had similar rates of esophagectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation as married Whites. Both single groups had lower rates of esophagectomy and chemotherapy than married Whites, but single Blacks were the least likely to undergo esophagectomy. Single patients were more likely to refuse treatment.Marital status differs significantly in Black and White patients with esophageal cancer and may help explain racial disparities in cancer care. Further research is needed to explore reasons for care underutilization in single patients and whether these differences translate into clinical outcomes. Marital status at dx is a field in the CR Star data!!\nNCDB (Schlottmann et al., 2020) NCDB Stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the odds of being offered no treatment at all and surgical treatment across race, primary insurance, travel distance, income, and education levels. but was histology included in their model? Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare 5-year survival rates across different treatment modalities. A total of 60,621 esophageal cancer patients were included. Black patients, uninsured patients, and patients living in areas with lower levels of education were more likely to be offered no treatment. Similarly, black race, female patients, nonprivately insured patients, and those living in areas with lower median residential income and lower education levels were associated with lower rates of surgery. Patients receiving surgical treatment, compared to both no treatment and definitive chemoradiation, had significant better long-term survival in stage I, II, and III esophageal cancer. Is the negative effect on survival due to race or insurance status/geography?\nNCDB stage I-III esophageal cancer 2004-2015 (Savitch et al., 2021) matched cohorts White:Black. Multi-level modeling was performed to control for random effects of individual hospitals on surgical utilization. 60,041 patients were included (4402 black; 55,639 white). After 1:1 matching, there were 5858 patients. For all stages, significantly fewer black than white patients received surgery. Black race independently conferred lower likelihood of receiving surgery in single-level multivariable analysis (OR (95% CI); stage I, 0.67 (0.48-0.94); stage II, 0.76 (0.60-0.96); stage III, 0.62 (0.50-0.76)) and after controlling for hospital random effects. Hospital-level random effects accounted for one third of the unexplained variance in receipt of surgery. Risk-adjusted 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality was higher for patients who did not undergo surgery. CONCLUSION: Black patients with esophageal cancer are at higher risk of mortality compared to white patients. This increased risk may be influenced by decreased likelihood of receiving surgical intervention for resectable disease, in part because of between-hospital differences. Improving access to surgical care may improve disparities in esophageal cancer survival. Another way of studying access to surgical care - this time at the facility level. Further support for the theme that access to surgery is barrier to optimal esophageal cancer care. Did this study account for histology? What about SES?\n(Swords et al., 2020) NCDB 2003-2011 Stage I-III esophageal cancer. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, *SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not.**\n(Erhunmwunsee et al., 2017) NCDB stage I-III 2003-2011. Median income by zip code and proportion of the zip code residents without a high school diploma were grouped into income and education quartiles, respectively and used as surrogates for SES. The association between race and overall survival stratified by SES is explored. Of 11,599 esophagectomy patients who met study criteria, 3,503 (30.2%) were in the highest income quartile, 2,847 (24.5%) were in the highest education quartile, and 610 patients (5%) were black. Before adjustment for SES, black patients had worse overall survival than white patients (median survival 23.0 versus 34.7 months, log rank p &lt; 0.001), and overall, survival times improved with increasing income and education (p &lt; 0.001 for both). After adjustment for putative prognostic factors, SES was associated with overall survival, whereas race was not. Did study include histology in their model?\n(Okereke et al., 2021) NCDB 2004-2017: 127,098 patients. All minority groups were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages versus Caucasians after adjusting for covariates (African American OR-1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.53-1.76], Hispanic OR-1.19 [1.08-1.32], Asian OR-1.78 [1.55-2.06]). After adjustment, all minorities were less likely at every stage to receive surgery. Despite these disparities, Hispanics and Asians had improved survival compared with Caucasians. African Americans had worse survival. Racial disparities for receiving surgery were present in both academic and community institutions, and at high-volume and low-volume institutions. Surgery partially mediated the survival difference between African Americans and Caucasians (HR-1.13 [1.10-1.16] and HR-1.04 [1.02-1.07], without and with adjustment of surgery). Surgery less often in Black patients but no correction for histology.\nCalifornia Cancer Registry (Tran et al., 2017) Esophageal cancer cases 2004-2010. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be in the lower SES strata and less likely to receive surgery than Caucasians in this cohort. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was similar across different racial/ethnic groups. After adjustment for stage, grade, histology, treatments, and SES in multivariate analyses, the mortality risk in African Americans (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.07) and Hispanics (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.07) did not differ from Caucasians (HR = 1.00, referent), with histology, SES, and surgery largely accounting for unadjusted OS differences. We also observed that African American men had higher adjusted risk of death relative to Caucasian men (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07-1.42), but this effect was not observed for African American women compared to Caucasian women (HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.94-1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Race is not an independent risk factor for OS in our population-based analysis of EC cases. Rather, observed differences in OS by race/ethnicity result from differences in cancer histology, SES, surgery, and gender. Sounds like receipt of surgery remains disparate based upon race and accounts for some differences in outcome"

    "text": "Identification of patients at elevated risk of systemic relapse is critical in the choice of optimal therapy at multiple points in the treatment pathway.\nNeoadjuvant chemoradiation has been demonstrated to be a useful adjunct to surgery in locally-advanced esophageal cancer without radiographic evidence of distant metastasis. Long-term analysis of the CROSS trial demonstrated that the addition of chemoradiation to surgery primarily reduces the risk of locoregional and mixed locoregional and systemic recurrences, but does not reduce the risk of isolated systemic recurrence.\nThere is clearly heterogeneity of tumor sensitivity to chemoradiation, as borne out by the observation from the CROSS trial of trimodality therapy, in which a pathologic complete response was noted in 23% of patients with adenocarcinoma and 49% of patients with squamous cell carcinoma. At the other end of spectrum, 30% of patients treated with trimodality therapy experienced systemic failure by 2 year after completion of treatment.\nAn understanding of the risk of systemic recurrence is crucial for rational decision-making regarding neoadjuvant therapy. Patients at low risk of systemic failure may be best treated with trimodality therapy along the lines of the CROSS trial, while patients at elevated risk of systemic failure may benefit from induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation.\nFor patients who have completed neoadjuvant therapy and had no evidence of metastatic disease on restaging, optimal therapy is to proceed to surgery. The ideal candidates for surgical therapy are those who have persistent local disease but have a low risk of occult metastatic disease.\nFor patients who have clinical evidence of persistent local disease after neoadjuvant therapy, the treatment options are surgery or systemic therapy. In this scenario, the risk of occult metastatic disease would be helpful in treatment decisions.\nFor patients who have had a complete clinical response, as judged by negative endoscopic biopsies and a robust response on imageing, active surveillance is an option. Active surveillance allows the natural history of esophageal cancer to become manifest during a period of regular endoscopy and imaging.\nThe SANO clinical trial (Surgery As Necessary Only) focused on patients with esophageal cancer who had completed chemoradiation and had no evidence of persistent disease on endscopy or imaging. They were randomized to immediate surgery or active surveillance. Active surveillance entailed periodic endoscopy and imaging. Patients found to have an isolated local recurrence were recommended for salvage esophagectomy. The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial with an acceptable survival difference between arms of 15%. Active surveillance was found to be non-inferior to immediate surgery.\nFor patients with a complete clinical response, the treatment options are immediate surgery, systemic chemotherapy, or active surveillance. These choices are again informed by an understanding of the risk of occult metastatic disease. Patients at high risk for systemic disease are likely best treated with systemic chemotherapy, while patients at low risk of systemic disease may ideal candidates for active surveillance, as a number of these patients may be found to have eradication of their disease by chemoradiation and may never need surgery.\nCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a small fractino of circulating cell-free ctDNA or “liquid biopsy” is a promising technology to estimate the risk of systemic disease at multiple points in a patient’s treatment pathway.\nThe presence of circulating, tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma is well established(11–13). In most patients, ctDNA represents a small fraction of the total circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA)(14), and is challenging to detect and quantify. Novel technologies, such as our sequencing approach(15,16), enable detection of these rare tumor mutations in an abundance of normal ccfDNA. Several studies have indicated that ctDNA burden correlates closely with overall disease burden(11,14,17,18). Thus, ctDNA provides a potential “liquid biopsy” that can be used to monitor cancer progression and recurrence during treatment.\n\nInitial diagnosis\nMRD window\nSurveillance\n\n\n\n\nDefize Algorithm\n\n\nRotterdam (Eyck et al., 2023) Detection of circulating tumour DNA after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer. J Pathol 2023; 259: 35–45. Samples taking before, 6 weeks after and 23 weeks after CRT. 29/31 patients had mutations detected on tissue biopsy. 24/31 (77%) had mutations potentially detectable in cfDNA. Pretreatment ctDNA detected in 9 (9/24 = 38%( patients, four of whom had incurable disease progression before surgery (2 prior to ChemoRT and 2 prior to surgery). None of these 9 had a pCR. 6/9 had major residual disease after chemoRT. After ChemoRT, ctDNA was detected in 3 patients (3/24 = 12.5%), two of whom had disease progression. Patients were examined wtih CT and EGD biopsies after ChemoRT as part of the SANO trial. ctDNA did not detect any additional patients with residual disease after ChemoRT. ctDNA analyzed with Thermo Fisher Colon Oncoline kit. \\(\\Rightarrow\\). ctDNA can detect some patients with high-risk disease who are at risk for progression (and should have further staging investigations prior to surgery OR be offered watch/wait), but did not help detect patients after ChemoRT who had residual disease (who would be candidates for salvage esophagectomy)\nMelbourne (Cabalag et al., 2022) 62 patients with adenocarcinoma with tumor-informed approach. 9 genes analyzed with targeted amplicon sequencing. Pre-treatment biopsies showed mutations in 55/62 (63%). ctDNA at baseline in 20/55 (36%). The majority (90%) of patients with detectable ctDNA had either locally advanced tumors, nodal involvement or metastatic disease. In patients with locally advanced tumors, disease free survival (DFS) was more accurately stratified using pre-treatment ctDNA status [HR 4.34 (95% CI 0.93-20.21); P = 0.05] compared to nodal status on PET-CT. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, patients who are node negative but ctDNA positive have inferior DFS [HR 11.71 (95% CI 1.16-118.80) P = 0.04]. In blood samples taken before and following NAT, clearance of ctDNA after NAT was associated with a favourable response to treatment. Furthermore, patients who are ctDNA positive during post-treatment surveillance are at high risk of relapse.\nSan Diego: (Kato et al., 2018) 55 GE adenocarcinoma (mostly advanced disease; 9, surgically resectable) ctDNA with Guardant (49/55) or Foundation. Esophagus =11, GEJ = 17, gastric = 27. Seventy-six percent of patients (42/55) had ≥1 genomic alteration [including variants of unknown significance (VUS)] and 69.1% (38/55) had ≥1 characterized alteration (excluding VUSs). The median number of alterations per patient was 2 (range, 0–15). TP53 (50.9%, 28/55), PIK3CA (16.4%, 9/55), ERBB2 (14.5%, 8/55), and KRAS (14.5%, 8/55) genes were most frequently affected characterized alterations. Thirty-one patients also had tissue NGS. Concordance between tissue and ctDNA ranged from 61.3% (TP53 alterations) to 87.1% (KRAS alterations). ERBB2 alterations were significantly associated with poor overall survival (HR, 14.06; 95% confidence interval, 2.44–81.03; P = 0.003 multivariate analysis). Among patients with ≥1 alteration, no 2 patients had identical molecular portfolios.\nStanford: (Azad et al., 2020): 45 patients receving chemoradiation for esophageal cancer. ctDNA analysis with deep squencing. Tumor-derived DNA represented 0.07% of all cell-free DNA. Detection of ctDNA following chemoradiotherapy was associated with tumor progression (hazard ratio, 18.7; P&lt;.0001), formation of distant metastases (hazard ratio, 32.1; P&lt;.0001), and shorter disease-specific survival times (hazard ratio, 23.1; P&lt;. 0001). A higher proportion of patients with tumor progression had new mutations detected in plasma samples collected after chemoradiotherapy than patients without progression (P=.03). Detection of ctDNA after chemoradiotherapy preceded radiographic evidence of tumor progression by an average of 2.8 months. Among patients who received chemoradiotherapy without surgery, combined ctDNA and metabolic imaging analysis predicted progression in 100% of patients with tumor progression, compared with 71% for only ctDNA detection and 57% for only metabolic imaging analysis. Before ChemoRT, ctDNA detected in 27/45 = 60%. After ChemoRT, ctDNA detected in 5/31 = 16%.\nZaanan A, Didelot A, Broudin C, et al. Longitudinal circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis during treatment (Tx) of locally advanced resectable (LAR) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) adenocarcinoma (ADENOCA): the PLAGAST prospective biomarker study.

During MRD interval, 23 patients had sampled drawn during the MRD window, of whom 3 had detectable ctDNA with 2/3 recurrences compared with 3/20 (15% among those with negative ctDNA. ctDNA detected during MRD window was associated with shorter disease-free survival (HR 6.2 p=0.049). 32 patients were studied during surveillance, of whom 5/5 (100%) recurred in those with positive ctDNA and 2/27 (7.4%) among ct-DNA negative.\nCRITICS trial (leal525?) identified post-neoadjuvant therapy or preoperative ctDNA as a predictive biomarker for pathological response (according to Mandard’s tumour regression grading [TRG] system0, with ctDNA analyses being consistent with TRG in 30 (70%) of 43 patients (p=0·03; Fisher’s exact test).\nIn the initial analysis of the PLAGAST study postoperative, tumour-informed ctDNA persistence was related to recurrence and overall survival. Additionally, the clearance of ctDNA after medical treatment could serve as a predictor of outcomes.\nin the metastatic setting, Kelly and colleagues observed in a phase 1–2 study a statistical correlation between mutation variant allele frequencies and overall response rate to ICIs in metastatic oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Patients with a decrease in variant allele frequencies at week 9 had a longer median OS (3.8 months, 95% CI 7·0–NR) than those with an increase in variant allele frequencies (8.2 months, 6·2–NR; HR 0·07, 95% CI 0·01–0·66).74 However, false-negative ctDNA results have been reported in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, restricting the utility of ctDNA as the sole predictive biomarker for oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma.\nRochester and Pittsburgh (Egyud et al., 2019) Tumor-informed detection of ctDNA within patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. Percentage of patients with detectable ctDNA increased with tumor stage. For patients with stage I or II disease, ctDNA was present in less than 50%, limiting its ability to detect esophageal cancer at an early stage.\nChidambaram S, Markar SR. Clinical utility and applicability of circulating tumor DNA testing in esophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Dis Esophagus. 2022;35:doab046.\n(Huffman et al., 2022) ctDNA levels were analyzed in the preoperative, postoperative, and surveillance settings in patients with EGC using a personalized multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based next-generation sequencing assay. Plasma samples (n = 943) from 295 patients at &gt; 70 institutions were collected before surgery, postoperatively, and/or serially during routine clinical follow-up from September 19, 2019, to February 21, 2022. A total of 295 patients with EGC were analyzed, and 212 patients with stages I-III disease were further explored. Pretreatment ctDNA was detected in 96% (23/24) of patients with preoperative time points. Postoperative ctDNA was detected in 23.5% (16/68) of patients with stage I-III EGC within 16 weeks (molecular residual disease window) after surgery without receiving systemic therapy. ctDNA detection at any time point after surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 23.6; 95% CI, 10.2 to 66.0; P &lt; .0001), within the molecular residual disease window (HR, 10.7; 95% CI, 4.3 to 29.3; P &lt; .0001), and during the surveillance period (HR, 17.7; 95% CI, 7.3 to 50.7; P &lt; .0001) was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival. In multivariable analysis, ctDNA status and clinical stage of disease were independently associated with outcomes. 125 patients with stage I–III oesophagogastric cancers were analysed at any timepoint postoperatively (regardless of adjuvant treatment). The median recurrence-free survival was not reached in patients negative for ctDNA, whereas it was 9·6 months in patients positive for ctDNA (HR 23·6, 95% CI 10·2–66·0; p=0·0001). These results were observed irrespective of the anatomical localisation of the tumour. Recurrence rates were 5% in patients negative for ctDNA and 88% in patients positive for ctDNA. The patient population enrolled in this study was heterogeneous and further prospective studies are required.\nCopenhagen (Iden et al., 2025): Patients with resectable gastric and GEJ AC, undergoing perioperative chemotherapy and surgery, were prospectively enrolled. Serial plasma samples were collected at baseline, after one cycle of chemotherapy, after preoperative chemotherapy, and after surgery. ctDNA was assessed by a ddPCR test (TriMeth), which targets the gastrointestinal cancer-specific methylation patterns of the genes C9orf50, KCNQ5, and CLIP4.\nResults: ctDNA analysis was performed on 229 plasma samples from 86 patients. At baseline, ctDNA was detected in 56% of patients, which decreased to 37% following one cycle of chemotherapy, 25% after preoperative chemotherapy and 15% after surgical resection. The presence of ctDNA after one cycle of chemotherapy was associated with reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR = 2.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-4.85, p = 0.005) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.07-4.62, p = 0.032). Similarly, ctDNA after surgery was associated with significantly shorter RFS (HR = 6.22, 95% CI 2.39-16.2, p &lt; 0.001) and OS (HR = 6.37, 95% CI 2.10-19.3, p = 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis confirmed ctDNA after surgery as an independent prognostic factor (p &lt; 0.001).\nWo JY, Clark JW, Eyler CE, Mino-Kenudson M, Klempner SJ, Allen JN, et al. Results and molecular correlates from a pilot study of neoadjuvant induction FOLFIRINOX followed by chemoradiation and surgery for gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas.

Complete celiac axis lymphadenectomy is performed. The left gastric and short gastric vessels are divided and the gastroepiploic arcade preserved in its entirety during gastric mobilization. Near infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green may be utilized to clearly identify and preserve the gastroepiploic arcade to its termination point.\nIn the setting of previous induction chemoradiation therapy, an omental flap based off of 2–3 omental perforating arteries may be harvested for later reinforcement of the gastroesophageal anastomosis.\nComplete gastric mobilization from the hiatus to the pylorus is performed. The gastric conduit is created with sequential applications of the endogastrointestinal stapler. The conduit is secured to the specimen for later traverse into the chest in proper orientation. The omental flap, if created, should be secured to the tip of the conduit to simplify transit into the chest as well."

Eight mm robotic ports are placed at the eighth intercostal space at the posterior axillary line, the third intercostal space in the mid to posterior axillary, fifth intercostal place into the mid axillary line, and at the ninth intercostal space approximately in line with the tip of the scapula. An assistant non-robotic port is placed at the site of the diaphragmatic insertion. Complete circumferential esophageal mobilization is performed from the level of the hiatus to the azygous vein with careful attention to harvest all periesophageal lymph node bearing tissues en bloc with the specimen. During dissection of the subcarinal lymph node packet, great care must be taken to avoid energy associated thermal injury to the membranous wall of the airways. Judicious use of both bipolar energy sources and non-energy dependent sharp and blunt dissection, and clear visualization and exposure of the dependent anatomy are critical to avoid these injuries which may result in esophageal/conduit airway fistulas. Additional mobilization of the esophagus towards the thoracic inlet is completed with careful attention to avoid traction or direct injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The conduit is delivered into the chest and sutured to the diaphragm. The caudal to cranial deep dissection along the contralateral pleura and left mainstem bronchus is completed with lateral retraction of the specimen once divided from the conduit."

    "text": "Hand-sewn Anastomosis\nItaly (Huscher et al., 2023) 40 patients over 4 years\nAll patients underwent a fast-track surgical protocol. The Da Vinci ® Si robotic system was positioned perpendicular to the patient’s right side and docked to the trocars. For the abdominal part of the procedure, the patient was positioned in a supine position. The four robotic trocars were placed in a horizontal line at or above the umbilicus (Fig. 1). In the abdomen, CO2 insufflation with 14 mmHg of pressure was used. Targeting to the stomach was performed. The surgical assistant was located on the left side of the table. A tip-up fenestrated grasper in trocar 1 was used to elevate the left lobe of the liver and for certain retraction movements during the abdominal part. The fenestrated bipolar forceps were used in the 12-mm trocar (no. 2) with a reduction cartridge, and later the 12-mm trocar was used for the robotic Endo Wrist ® stapler 45 mm to form the gastric conduit, beginning from the lesser curvature near the crow foot and continued towards the fundus, parallel to the greater curvature. After the abdominal dissection and creation of the conduit for reconstruction, Indocyanine Green (ICG) test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of the gastric conduit. For the thoracic part of the procedure (Fig. 2), the patient was positioned in a prone position (the operation table was tilted 19° towards the prone) and three robotic trocars and one laparoscopic trocar were inserted on the right chest. A single-lumen tube was used for intubation and the right lung was not deflated and disconnected from ventilation. In the chest, CO2 insufflation with 8 mmHg of pressure was enough to obtain an optimal working volume. The pulmonary ligament was divided. Hereafter, the parietal pleura was dissected at the anterior side of the esophagus from the diaphragm, up to the azygos vein. The azygos vein was ligated with Hem-o-lok and divided. At the posterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is dissected cranially to caudally along the azygos vein, including the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct was clipped with a 10-mm endoclip. To facilitate esophagus mobilization, a Penrose drain was placed around the esophagus to manipulate the esophagus for further mobilization. The thoracic esophagus was mobilized and transected at the level of the azygos vein. The esophagus was resected en bloc with the surrounding mediastinal lymph nodes. The resected specimen will contain right-side paratracheal (station 2R), tracheobronchial (station 4), aortopulmonary window (station 5), carinal (station 7), and periesophageal (station 8) lymph nodes. The reconstruction time started with the anchoring of the gastric conduit to the esophageal stump with two 3–0 silk stay sutures. The conduit was opened on the anterior wall by the adoption of a monopolar hook. An end-to-side roboticsewn anastomosis was created by the adoption of two 3–0 running barbed sutures (V-loc – Medtronic, USA – Fig. 3).11, 12 After completion of the anterior wall, a nasogastric tube was passed through the half-completed anastomosis. Once the anastomosis was completed, 3–0 silk interrupted sutures were placed circumferentially to reinforce it (Fig. 4; Video). Before and after anastomosis fashioning, an ICG test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of conduit. In addition, the conduit cul-de-sac was suspended at the posterior thoracic wall by two stitches. The specimen was extracted through a small thoracotomy and a right-sided chest tube was placed. No postoperative swallow tests were performed. In the absence of clinical signs of anastomotic dehiscence (for example, luminal contents through the drain or wound site/local inflammation; fever (&gt; 38 °C) or leukocytosis (&gt; 10,000/L); leak may also be detected on imaging studies), patients started with sips of water at the day 3 and the oral intake was gradually increased to solid food. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines were used in the postoperative protocol.\nLeak rate 4/40 = 10%\nStricture 10/40 = 25%\nItaly 30 patients (Marano et al., 2023)\nSingle‐lung ventilation is introduced, and the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, tilted 45° compared to the prone position. For both robotic systems, the cart is docked from the right side of the patient. In addition, three robotic ports are put in place as well as two thoracoscopic ports for the assistant. dV®SiTM port layout for this stage has previously been described [24]. It’s worthy of mention that an additional 5 mm port for the assistant is placed between the intercostal spaces (ICS) 6 and 10, along the posterior axillary line. Figure 2 shows the dV®XiTM trocar position (three-arms technique) in a slight U shape: robotic arm#1(R1) for the grasper or the bipolar forceps at the ICS 9, robotic arm#2 (R2) for the 30° down scope at the ICS 6, posterior to the posterior axillary line and robotic arm#3 (R3) for the monopolar cautery hook, the needle driver or the clip applier at the ICS 4, anterior to the scapular rim. Furthermore assistant port #1(A1, 12-mm) is located in the ILC 8, and assistant port #2 (A2, 5 mm) between R2 and R3 at the posterior axillary line. The targeting area is identified at the level of the Azygos arch. A 7–8 mmHg pneumothorax is then induced. Starting at the anterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is cut from the level of the azygos arch down to the diaphragm where the pulmonary ligament is divided. The azygos arch is then sectioned with robotic Weck Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) and a right paratracheal lymphadenectomy is performed. Next, the dissection of the parietal pleura is deepened towards the esophageal hiatus until the aorta becomes exposed. Subsequently, the right vagus nerve is sectioned just below the carina, preserving its bronchial branches. The dissection of the esophagus is extended below the tracheal bifurcation and a Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus to facilitate traction.\nThe dissection of the esophagus is then continued along the pericardium down to the diaphragm and the thoracic duct is clipped with robotic clips. The resection of the esophagus en-bloc with periesophageal, bronchial and subcarinal nodes (stations # 107–111) and the thoracic duct is fully completed from the diaphragm up to the azygos arch. The proximal esophagus is divided using a robotic cautery hook above the level of the azygos vein. At this point, the instruments in R1 and R3 are reversed to be able to carefully pull the esophago-gastric bloc and the gastric conduit up through the hiatus until the marker suture becomes visible. The specimen and conduit thus are disconnected, and the specimen is placed in a plastic bag which will be removed through the enlarged incision of the assistant port. Thereafter, four supportive 4-0 polyglactin 910 (Ethicon Inc. USA) stitches are put in between the mucosae and the muscularis externa layer of the esophagus at the four cardinal points to evert the esophageal mucosae. Next, the proximal esophagus is dilatated using a Foley catheter inflated with 10 cc of sterile water for approximately 2–3 min. After having assessed both gastric conduit and esophageal perfusion with ICG fluorescence, a gastrotomy is performed at the most proximal portion of the conduit, maintaining at least 2 cm of distance from the stapler line. A single-layer robot-sewn esophagogastric anastomosis is performed above the level of the azygos arch with two separate running self-locking barbed sutures (Filbloc® 3/0, Assut Europe, Italy or alternatively V-LocTM 3/0, Medtronic, USA) that run in the same direction from 3 to 9 o’clock. Of note is the fact that, after having applied the first stitch on the posterior wall we customarily pass the needle back below the first stitch to evert the posterior esophageal and gastric layer and improve their visualization. Once the posterior aspect of the anastomosis is complete, a NGT is placed under direct vision inside the stomach distally to the anastomosis, thus accomplishing the closure of anterior surface. Finally, a few tension release stitches are put in between the mediastinal pleura and seromuscular layer of the gastric tube. The anastomosis is checked for intraoperative leaks with methylene blue and a 28-Fr chest drain is inserted via the R1 robotic trocar, posteriorly to anastomosis, with the apex in the upper chest (Video).\nStricture 8/30 = 27%\n\nVagus nerve preservation\nFujita Pulmonary vagus nerve preservation for preserving respiratory function Jpn J Surg 18:31 (Fujita et al., 1988)\nPulmonary vagus nerve preservation during esophagectomy (Weijs et al., 2016)\nSurgical anatomy of esophagus (Weijs et al., 2017)\nMeso-esophagus (Cuesta et al., 2015)\nSupracarinal esophagus (Cuesta et al., 2017)\nTopography of pulmonary vagus nerve (Weijs et al., 2015)\n\n\nUpper mediastinal lymphadenectomy\n??

Type II: Localized defect, requiring interventional but not surgical therapy, for example interventional radiology drain, stent, or bedside opening and packing of incision. Type III: Localized defect requiring surgical therapy.\nConduit necrosis was defined as postoperative identification of necrosis or ischemia affecting the gastric conduit, and was further categorized as: Type I: Focal necrosis identified endoscopically, requiring additional monitoring or nonsurgical therapy. Type II: Focal necrosis identified endoscopically, and not associated with free anastomotic or conduit leak, which required surgical therapy not involving esophageal diversion.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Esophageal Perforation\nPerforation can occur through mucosa, muscle, or adventitia. The esophagus lacks a serosal layer, which makes it more susceptible to perforation. Once perforation occurs, gastric contents and bile enter the mediastinum, and necrotizing mediastinitis develops. Polymicrobial invasion by bacteria, such as Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, and Bacteroides, occurs within 12 hours, and the infection may result in fluid sequestration, sepsis, and death.\n\n\nEtiology\n\nIatrogenic, most frequently endoscopy. The most common site of injury is the cricopharyngeus, but when esophageal dilatation is performed, the site of perforation is at the stricture of the original disease.\nPostemesis, such as Boerhaave syndrome. Other causes of a sudden rise in intraesophageal pressure include weightlifting, laughing, hyperemesis gravidarum, and seizures. Spontaneous rupture almost always occurs on the left side of the distal third of the esophagus.\nTrauma (penetrating and blunt).\nSteering wheel injury\nPharmacologic agents: KCl, NSAIDs\nCaustic injury\n\n\n\nDiagnosis (Physical Findings)\n\nPE crepitus chest, neck, or face; neck swelling; epigastric tenderness; and nasal voice. Sometimes results are normal.\n\n\n\nDiagnostic Tests\nCXR: Pleural effusion, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous\nCT Esophagram\nUpper GI with gastrograffin (?)\n\n\nTreatment\n-Treatment of contamination -Wide local drainage -Source control -Enteral feeding access\n\n\nSurgical Options\n\nHigh perforations (cerviaL)\nMid-esohageal\nLower esophagus\n\n\n\nSurgical Principles\n\nMyotomy for exposure and debridement\nPrimary repair\n\nSmall injuries\nTwo layers\nTissue flap (intercostal, pericardial flap, pleura, omentum)\n\nT tube for larger injuries\nEsophageal exclusion with cervical esophagostomy\n\n\n\nNonoperative Management\n\nClinical stability, with minimal signs of sepsis or systemic inflammatory response on presentation. Patients must remain this way; they should have a reliable examination and constant monitoring for any changes in clinical status.\nInstrumental perforations in which patients have been nil per os (NPO; nothing by mouth) and in which the perforation is detected early or “tolerance” develops to the perforation without the need for surgery\nPerforation contained within the neck or mediastinum with no extravasation and no signs of crepitus, pneumothorax, or pneumoperitoneum\n\n\n\nNon-operative management\n\nNPO status\nIV fluid resuscitation\nAntibiotics (including antifungal)\nNutrition (enteral or parenteral)"

Among GI cancer patients, half will be iron deficient as defined by transferrin saturation &lt;20%, but 80% of them will have ferritin &gt;30ng/mL (Ludwig et al., 2013)\nCancer patients with anemia are best treated with a combination of iron infusion and EPO as opposed to EPO alone(Auerbach et al., 2004) (Bastit et al., 2008). Treatment with IV iron in addition to erythrocyte-stimulating agents (ESAs) results in cost savings, due primarily to lower requirement for ESAs(Luporsi et al., 2012)\nMeta-analysis of addition of iron infusion to ESAs(Petrelli et al., 2012)"

Survival after esophagectomy worsened with increasing age and decreased considerably after age 73. More use of dCRT after age 73. Survival benefit of surgery over chemoradiation in all ages, including octogenarians.\nSEER (Lv et al., 2021) 1596 Elderly patients with esophageal cancer: 278 had surgery.  Longer survival with trimodality therapy.\nThe perioperative period is when patients are at most risk of developing cardiopulmonary complications with an operative mortality rate of 13.4% in those who are between 70–79 years old and 19.9% in those over the age of 80 (7,8).\nOperative mortality after esophagectomy in those over age 80 is 19.9% (vs 8.8% under age 90) from National Inpatient Sample data (Finlayson et al., 2007)\n\n\nFrailty and complications after esophagectomy\nDublin (Elliott et al., 2017) Sarcopenia present in XX % and was associated with increased risk of perioperative complications. Sarcopenia was not associated with hospital mortality, which was 1%. Sarcopenia was associated with reduced 5-year survival, as was loss of muscle mass during neoadjuvant therapy.\nReview of sarcopenia and outcomes after GI cancer surgery (Su et al., 2019) Sarcopenia associated with increased risk of postoperative complications and decreased survival after esophagectomy.\nNegative impact of muscle wasting after chemotherapy followed by surgery (Mayanagi et al., 2017) 66 pts\nSarcopenia as a predictor of pulmonary complications after esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer (Nishigori et al., 2016)\n\n\nFrailty and survival after esophagectomy\n\n\nRetrospective Trimodality vs dCRT\nItaly (Castoro et al., 2013) Squamous cell 77 patients over 16 years.

Adenocarcinoma: better survival with Trimodality. SCCA: Age &gt;75 or &gt;2 comorbidities overall survival was comparable between groups.\nTaiwan (Wang et al., 2019) 5832 patients with SCC: Trimodality in 1754 and dCRT in 4078. Survival at 3 years 41% with trimodality vs 17% with dCRT\nMDACC (Zhou et al., 2021) Squamous cell: 143 Trimodality-eligible patients: 60 had trimodality therapy and 83 had chemoRT. Longer survival in trimodality group (77 vs 33 months). For those with a complete clinical response, trimodality resulted in 123 moths survival vs 55 months with dCRT.

Start by dissecting esophagus from trachea, then outline inferior border of right and left mainstem bronchi. Keep Station 7 lymph nodes on the specimen.\nDissect 4L nodes, if desired.\nDissect Station 5 nodes\n.Completion of conduit and removal of specimen. The conduit is delivered into the thorax. This is done using a laparoscopic graster. Ensure staple line faces you (right side). The specimen is removed through the assistant port incision. An Alexis port is used to seal the extraction site. Stomach is pulled into the chest until the Vicryl marker suture is seen.\nDivision of esophagus just above level of azygous vein. ICG can be used to check perfusion. If there is any question about the length of the conduit, confirm the length of the conduit prior to division of the esophagus.\n\n\nCircular stapled anastomosis\nLarge needle driver to grasp anvil\nCamera moved back to Port 3 (from 2) to visualize anastomosis better \nPort #1 may need to be remove for visibiity\nIntact minor gastric curvature of the transected specimen is brought out of the chest through the mini-thoracotomy. To insert the circular staper handle the stomach conduit is opene by incision the stapler line previusly created at the antrum in the minor curvaturell. The incision is made in the distal third of the antrum to introduce the stapler handle as far away from the gastro-esophageal crossing and allow a large distance to the greater curvature.\n\n\n\nHand-sewn Anastomosis\nPosterior running 4-0 Stratafix running posterior wall\n\nConduit and esophagus opened anterior to staple lines, which are incorporated into the staple line. Take care to ensure incision length is the same on conduit vs esophagus.\nNext the lumen of the esophagus is held up with a Cadiere Forceps by the da Vinci, while the assistant exposes the gastric tube in order to minimize the tension on the tissue . The second layer of the back wall is created by a running Stratafix Spiral® 3-0 (SH) suture placed transmural. The suture is started dorsally (9 o’clock position) and continued to ventrally (3o’clock) via the 6 o’clock position with the needle inside-out on the esophagus and outside-in on the gastric conduit. The knot is placed extraluminally.\n\n\n\n\nThe anterior front wall is closed with 2 Stratafix Spiral 3-0 sutures starting one each at the dorsal and ventral edge of the remaining opening. The first suture is started dorsally (9 o’clock) and run to the middle of the opening at 12 o’clock. The second suture is run from ventrally 3 o´clock finishing ventral at 12 o´clock, meeting the first suture line. The securing knot is placed extraluminally.\n\nThe previously mobilized mediastinal pleura is closed with either single stitches or a running suture on top of anastomosis starting at azygos stump for about 4 cm distal, and pulling in small piece of omentum for protection. This enables fixation of the gastric tube and reinforcement of the anastomosis.\n\n\nLinear Stapled Anastomosis\nThe esophageal stump is opened on the (right side) within the middle with cold scissors or monopolar cautery hook proximal to the transecting stapler line\nThe site for linear stapler insertion is measured to be at least 6 cm distal to the transecting staple line on the gastric conduit. The incision is made using monopolar cautery close to the gastroepiploic arcade\nFour retraction sutures are placed (dorsal, ventral, medial and lateral) around the opened esophageal lumen, making sure to fixate the mucosa to the rest of the esophageal wall. These retraction sutures will serve for applying optimal retraction on the stump for anastomotic suturing as well as help guide the esophageal stump over the stapler anvil.\nThe EndoWrist stapler anvil and cartridge jaw (30 mm length) are inserted into the appropriate lumens while the console surgeon guides the tissue onto the stapler with the da Vinci instruments. Once sufficient tissue overlap is achieved (approximately 60 mm) the stapler is fired (blue reload) and the gastric conduit and esophageal stump are connected dorsally side-to-side\n34Fr gastric tube inserted.

The omental flap is positioned between the conduit and airway and the anastomosis is loosely wrapped.\nGrimminger PP, Hadzijusufovic E, Lang H: Robotic-Assisted Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy (RAMIE) with a Standardized Intrathoracic Circular End-to-side Stapled Anastomosis and a Team of Two (Surgeon and Assistant Only). Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 66:404406, 2018\n\nHand-sewn anastomosis\nHand-sewn Anastomosis (Ng et al., 2025) Anastomotic leakage occurred in 11 patients (12.4%), which involved a grade I leak in four patients (4.5%), grade II leak in one patient (1.1%), and grade III leakage in six patients (6.7%). Stricture rate was 32.6% (29 patients) at 1 year post-operatively for which dilation was needed for all patients.\nHand-sewn vs Stapled (Groot et al., 2020) Compared Utrecht to Sweden 2016-2019. 68 hand-sewn vs 60 stapled. Hand-sewn leak rate was 40% for cases 1-10 and 10% for cases 59-68. Overall leakage after hand-sewn in 22 patients (32%): Grade 1 =5(7%), Grade 2= 7(10%), Grade 3 10 (15%). see (Egberts et al., 2019)\nOverall leakage after stapled anastomosis in 10 (17%). Stapled anastomosis leak rate 10% for cases 1-10 and 20% for cases 51-60.\nLearning Curve for Hand-sewn McKeown Esophagectomhy (vandersulis264?)\nA robot-assisted, single-layer running, hand-sewn technique was applied to first close the posterior wall and then the anterior wall by two separate suturing wires that were placed in identical direction to end at the same site (i.e. from 9 to 3 o’clock). If possible, the tip of the gastric conduit was removed, and an omental wrap was positioned around the anastomosis. The surgical technique was refined during the inclusion period. The first 13 cases were end-to-end (E-T-E) anastomoses. After consecutive case 13, a transit was made to an end-toside (E-T-S) anastomosis in order to be able to better tailor the level of the anastomosis at the level of the gastric tube. Furthermore, at consecutive case 18, the surgical team switched from using V-Loc 3.0 barbed suture wires (Medtronic) to Stratafix 3.0 (Ethicon) barbed suture wires. The reason for the change was that the more rigid v-lock suture could damage the esophageal wall at the level of the stiches. Starting with consecutive case 21, four supportive stitches were placed in the esophagus (i.e. at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock) before initiating the suturing. Finally, to avoid traction on the anastomosis, four tension-release stitches (i.e. at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock) were placed in the serosa of the esophagus and gastric conduit from consecutive case 47 onward. Consequently, the final anastomotic technique involved an E-T-S intrathoracic anastomosis that was created by the successive placement of four supportive stitches, single layer continuous suturing of the posterior and anterior wall with two separate Stratafix wires, four tension release stiches and an omental wrap. The incision in the gastric conduit for creating the anastomosis was made as far as possible from the longitudinal staple line and near the omentum.\nCircular stapled anastomosis: The creation of the gastric tube is deliberately incomplete. The small gastric curvature later serves to introduce the circular stapling device in the thoracic part of the operation and is resected afterward. From our point of view, the main advantage of this method is the possibility to determine the needed length of the gastric tube in the thoracic part of the operation. The anastomosis begins with the introduction of the circular stapler anvil in the transected esophageal stump. The fixation of the anvil is secured by a pursestring suture (Stratafix 3.0). For this fixation, we use a barbed suture, which delivers a very good result especially with the robot.19 For this purpose, the bougie (24Ch) that was introduced to prevent an esophageal spasm is withdrawn. The minor curvature is now brought to the thoracic wall and incised through the assistant port. A circular stapling device with a diameter of 29 mm can now be inserted. Now, a suitable location for anastomosis can be selected near the greater curvature. Here, particular attention should be paid to the correct length of the gastric tube: the anastomosis should not be under tension, but a gastric tube that is too long can lead to emptying disorders postoperatively due to the formation of a siphon and might be not well perfused. For that reason, routinely fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green is performed to ensure adequate perfusion of the gastric tube. After selecting the appropriate location, the mandrel is extended and connected to the anvil. An assistant puts the gastric tube under slight tension and completes the anastomosis. After insertion of a bougie past the anastomosis, the minor curvature is transected with a linear stapling device, and the specimen is salvaged via the assistant port. This is followed by the circular stitch over of the anastomosis and the proximal row of the gastric staple line. It can be helpful to change the camera to arm 2, resulting in a superior overview and improved freedom of movement for the bedside surgeon.\n\n\n\nStapled Anastomosis\nMIE collected series of 646 cases of Ivor Lewis esophagectomy found plateau of anastomotic leak at 8% (Workum et al., 2019). Cases from from European center. his study included 646 patients. Three of the 4 hospitals reached the plateau of 8% anastomotic leakage. The length of the learning curve was 119 cases. The mean incidence of anastomotic leakage decreased from 18.8% during the learning phase to 4.5% after the plateau had been reached (P &lt; 0.001). Thirty-six extra patients (10.1% of all patients operated on during the learning curve) experienced learning associated anastomotic leakage, that could have been avoided if patients were operated by surgeons who had completed the learning curve. The incidence of textbook outcome increased from 28% to 53% and the mean operative time decreased from 344 minutes to 270 minutes.\nInternatioal Upper GI Association: Kingma BF, Grimminger PP, van der Sluis PC et al (2020) World- wide techniques and outcomes in robot-assisted minimally inva- sive esophagectomy (RAMIE).

    "text": "Hand-sewn Anastomosis\nItaly (Huscher et al., 2023) 40 patients over 4 years\nAll patients underwent a fast-track surgical protocol. The Da Vinci ® Si robotic system was positioned perpendicular to the patient’s right side and docked to the trocars. For the abdominal part of the procedure, the patient was positioned in a supine position. The four robotic trocars were placed in a horizontal line at or above the umbilicus (Fig. 1). In the abdomen, CO2 insufflation with 14 mmHg of pressure was used. Targeting to the stomach was performed. The surgical assistant was located on the left side of the table. A tip-up fenestrated grasper in trocar 1 was used to elevate the left lobe of the liver and for certain retraction movements during the abdominal part. The fenestrated bipolar forceps were used in the 12-mm trocar (no. 2) with a reduction cartridge, and later the 12-mm trocar was used for the robotic Endo Wrist ® stapler 45 mm to form the gastric conduit, beginning from the lesser curvature near the crow foot and continued towards the fundus, parallel to the greater curvature. After the abdominal dissection and creation of the conduit for reconstruction, Indocyanine Green (ICG) test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of the gastric conduit. For the thoracic part of the procedure (Fig. 2), the patient was positioned in a prone position (the operation table was tilted 19° towards the prone) and three robotic trocars and one laparoscopic trocar were inserted on the right chest. A single-lumen tube was used for intubation and the right lung was not deflated and disconnected from ventilation. In the chest, CO2 insufflation with 8 mmHg of pressure was enough to obtain an optimal working volume. The pulmonary ligament was divided. Hereafter, the parietal pleura was dissected at the anterior side of the esophagus from the diaphragm, up to the azygos vein. The azygos vein was ligated with Hem-o-lok and divided. At the posterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is dissected cranially to caudally along the azygos vein, including the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct was clipped with a 10-mm endoclip. To facilitate esophagus mobilization, a Penrose drain was placed around the esophagus to manipulate the esophagus for further mobilization. The thoracic esophagus was mobilized and transected at the level of the azygos vein. The esophagus was resected en bloc with the surrounding mediastinal lymph nodes. The resected specimen will contain right-side paratracheal (station 2R), tracheobronchial (station 4), aortopulmonary window (station 5), carinal (station 7), and periesophageal (station 8) lymph nodes. The reconstruction time started with the anchoring of the gastric conduit to the esophageal stump with two 3–0 silk stay sutures. The conduit was opened on the anterior wall by the adoption of a monopolar hook. An end-to-side roboticsewn anastomosis was created by the adoption of two 3–0 running barbed sutures (V-loc – Medtronic, USA – Fig. 3).11, 12 After completion of the anterior wall, a nasogastric tube was passed through the half-completed anastomosis. Once the anastomosis was completed, 3–0 silk interrupted sutures were placed circumferentially to reinforce it (Fig. 4; Video). Before and after anastomosis fashioning, an ICG test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of conduit. In addition, the conduit cul-de-sac was suspended at the posterior thoracic wall by two stitches. The specimen was extracted through a small thoracotomy and a right-sided chest tube was placed. No postoperative swallow tests were performed. In the absence of clinical signs of anastomotic dehiscence (for example, luminal contents through the drain or wound site/local inflammation; fever (&gt; 38 °C) or leukocytosis (&gt; 10,000/L); leak may also be detected on imaging studies), patients started with sips of water at the day 3 and the oral intake was gradually increased to solid food. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines were used in the postoperative protocol.\nLeak rate 4/40 = 10%\nStricture 10/40 = 25%\nItaly 30 patients (Marano et al., 2023)\nSingle‐lung ventilation is introduced, and the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, tilted 45° compared to the prone position. For both robotic systems, the cart is docked from the right side of the patient. In addition, three robotic ports are put in place as well as two thoracoscopic ports for the assistant. dV®SiTM port layout for this stage has previously been described [24]. It’s worthy of mention that an additional 5 mm port for the assistant is placed between the intercostal spaces (ICS) 6 and 10, along the posterior axillary line. Figure 2 shows the dV®XiTM trocar position (three-arms technique) in a slight U shape: robotic arm#1(R1) for the grasper or the bipolar forceps at the ICS 9, robotic arm#2 (R2) for the 30° down scope at the ICS 6, posterior to the posterior axillary line and robotic arm#3 (R3) for the monopolar cautery hook, the needle driver or the clip applier at the ICS 4, anterior to the scapular rim. Furthermore assistant port #1(A1, 12-mm) is located in the ILC 8, and assistant port #2 (A2, 5 mm) between R2 and R3 at the posterior axillary line. The targeting area is identified at the level of the Azygos arch. A 7–8 mmHg pneumothorax is then induced. Starting at the anterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is cut from the level of the azygos arch down to the diaphragm where the pulmonary ligament is divided. The azygos arch is then sectioned with robotic Weck Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) and a right paratracheal lymphadenectomy is performed. Next, the dissection of the parietal pleura is deepened towards the esophageal hiatus until the aorta becomes exposed. Subsequently, the right vagus nerve is sectioned just below the carina, preserving its bronchial branches. The dissection of the esophagus is extended below the tracheal bifurcation and a Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus to facilitate traction.\nThe dissection of the esophagus is then continued along the pericardium down to the diaphragm and the thoracic duct is clipped with robotic clips. The resection of the esophagus en-bloc with periesophageal, bronchial and subcarinal nodes (stations # 107–111) and the thoracic duct is fully completed from the diaphragm up to the azygos arch. The proximal esophagus is divided using a robotic cautery hook above the level of the azygos vein. At this point, the instruments in R1 and R3 are reversed to be able to carefully pull the esophago-gastric bloc and the gastric conduit up through the hiatus until the marker suture becomes visible. The specimen and conduit thus are disconnected, and the specimen is placed in a plastic bag which will be removed through the enlarged incision of the assistant port. Thereafter, four supportive 4-0 polyglactin 910 (Ethicon Inc. USA) stitches are put in between the mucosae and the muscularis externa layer of the esophagus at the four cardinal points to evert the esophageal mucosae. Next, the proximal esophagus is dilatated using a Foley catheter inflated with 10 cc of sterile water for approximately 2–3 min. After having assessed both gastric conduit and esophageal perfusion with ICG fluorescence, a gastrotomy is performed at the most proximal portion of the conduit, maintaining at least 2 cm of distance from the stapler line. A single-layer robot-sewn esophagogastric anastomosis is performed above the level of the azygos arch with two separate running self-locking barbed sutures (Filbloc® 3/0, Assut Europe, Italy or alternatively V-LocTM 3/0, Medtronic, USA) that run in the same direction from 3 to 9 o’clock. Of note is the fact that, after having applied the first stitch on the posterior wall we customarily pass the needle back below the first stitch to evert the posterior esophageal and gastric layer and improve their visualization. Once the posterior aspect of the anastomosis is complete, a NGT is placed under direct vision inside the stomach distally to the anastomosis, thus accomplishing the closure of anterior surface. Finally, a few tension release stitches are put in between the mediastinal pleura and seromuscular layer of the gastric tube. The anastomosis is checked for intraoperative leaks with methylene blue and a 28-Fr chest drain is inserted via the R1 robotic trocar, posteriorly to anastomosis, with the apex in the upper chest (Video).\nStricture 8/30 = 27%"

The Da Vinci ® Si robotic system was positioned perpendicular to the patient’s right side and docked to the trocars. For the abdominal part of the procedure, the patient was positioned in a supine position. The four robotic trocars were placed in a horizontal line at or above the umbilicus (Fig. 1). In the abdomen, CO2 insufflation with 14 mmHg of pressure was used. Targeting to the stomach was performed. The surgical assistant was located on the left side of the table. A tip-up fenestrated grasper in trocar 1 was used to elevate the left lobe of the liver and for certain retraction movements during the abdominal part. The fenestrated bipolar forceps were used in the 12-mm trocar (no. 2) with a reduction cartridge, and later the 12-mm trocar was used for the robotic Endo Wrist ® stapler 45 mm to form the gastric conduit, beginning from the lesser curvature near the crow foot and continued towards the fundus, parallel to the greater curvature. After the abdominal dissection and creation of the conduit for reconstruction, Indocyanine Green (ICG) test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of the gastric conduit. For the thoracic part of the procedure (Fig. 2), the patient was positioned in a prone position (the operation table was tilted 19° towards the prone) and three robotic trocars and one laparoscopic trocar were inserted on the right chest. A single-lumen tube was used for intubation and the right lung was not deflated and disconnected from ventilation. In the chest, CO2 insufflation with 8 mmHg of pressure was enough to obtain an optimal working volume. The pulmonary ligament was divided. Hereafter, the parietal pleura was dissected at the anterior side of the esophagus from the diaphragm, up to the azygos vein. The azygos vein was ligated with Hem-o-lok and divided. At the posterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is dissected cranially to caudally along the azygos vein, including the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct was clipped with a 10-mm endoclip. To facilitate esophagus mobilization, a Penrose drain was placed around the esophagus to manipulate the esophagus for further mobilization. The thoracic esophagus was mobilized and transected at the level of the azygos vein. The esophagus was resected en bloc with the surrounding mediastinal lymph nodes. The resected specimen will contain right-side paratracheal (station 2R), tracheobronchial (station 4), aortopulmonary window (station 5), carinal (station 7), and periesophageal (station 8) lymph nodes.

Before and after anastomosis fashioning, an ICG test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of conduit. In addition, the conduit cul-de-sac was suspended at the posterior thoracic wall by two stitches. The specimen was extracted through a small thoracotomy and a right-sided chest tube was placed. No postoperative swallow tests were performed. In the absence of clinical signs of anastomotic dehiscence (for example, luminal contents through the drain or wound site/local inflammation; fever (&gt; 38 °C) or leukocytosis (&gt; 10,000/L); leak may also be detected on imaging studies), patients started with sips of water at the day 3 and the oral intake was gradually increased to solid food.

It’s worthy of mention that an additional 5 mm port for the assistant is placed between the intercostal spaces (ICS) 6 and 10, along the posterior axillary line. Figure 2 shows the dV®XiTM trocar position (three-arms technique) in a slight U shape: robotic arm#1(R1) for the grasper or the bipolar forceps at the ICS 9, robotic arm#2 (R2) for the 30° down scope at the ICS 6, posterior to the posterior axillary line and robotic arm#3 (R3) for the monopolar cautery hook, the needle driver or the clip applier at the ICS 4, anterior to the scapular rim.

    "text": "Hand-sewn Anastomosis\nItaly (Huscher et al., 2023) 40 patients over 4 years\nAll patients underwent a fast-track surgical protocol. The Da Vinci ® Si robotic system was positioned perpendicular to the patient’s right side and docked to the trocars. For the abdominal part of the procedure, the patient was positioned in a supine position. The four robotic trocars were placed in a horizontal line at or above the umbilicus (Fig. 1). In the abdomen, CO2 insufflation with 14 mmHg of pressure was used. Targeting to the stomach was performed. The surgical assistant was located on the left side of the table. A tip-up fenestrated grasper in trocar 1 was used to elevate the left lobe of the liver and for certain retraction movements during the abdominal part. The fenestrated bipolar forceps were used in the 12-mm trocar (no. 2) with a reduction cartridge, and later the 12-mm trocar was used for the robotic Endo Wrist ® stapler 45 mm to form the gastric conduit, beginning from the lesser curvature near the crow foot and continued towards the fundus, parallel to the greater curvature. After the abdominal dissection and creation of the conduit for reconstruction, Indocyanine Green (ICG) test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of the gastric conduit. For the thoracic part of the procedure (Fig. 2), the patient was positioned in a prone position (the operation table was tilted 19° towards the prone) and three robotic trocars and one laparoscopic trocar were inserted on the right chest. A single-lumen tube was used for intubation and the right lung was not deflated and disconnected from ventilation. In the chest, CO2 insufflation with 8 mmHg of pressure was enough to obtain an optimal working volume. The pulmonary ligament was divided. Hereafter, the parietal pleura was dissected at the anterior side of the esophagus from the diaphragm, up to the azygos vein. The azygos vein was ligated with Hem-o-lok and divided. At the posterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is dissected cranially to caudally along the azygos vein, including the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct was clipped with a 10-mm endoclip. To facilitate esophagus mobilization, a Penrose drain was placed around the esophagus to manipulate the esophagus for further mobilization. The thoracic esophagus was mobilized and transected at the level of the azygos vein. The esophagus was resected en bloc with the surrounding mediastinal lymph nodes. The resected specimen will contain right-side paratracheal (station 2R), tracheobronchial (station 4), aortopulmonary window (station 5), carinal (station 7), and periesophageal (station 8) lymph nodes. The reconstruction time started with the anchoring of the gastric conduit to the esophageal stump with two 3–0 silk stay sutures. The conduit was opened on the anterior wall by the adoption of a monopolar hook. An end-to-side roboticsewn anastomosis was created by the adoption of two 3–0 running barbed sutures (V-loc – Medtronic, USA – Fig. 3).11, 12 After completion of the anterior wall, a nasogastric tube was passed through the half-completed anastomosis. Once the anastomosis was completed, 3–0 silk interrupted sutures were placed circumferentially to reinforce it (Fig. 4; Video). Before and after anastomosis fashioning, an ICG test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of conduit. In addition, the conduit cul-de-sac was suspended at the posterior thoracic wall by two stitches. The specimen was extracted through a small thoracotomy and a right-sided chest tube was placed. No postoperative swallow tests were performed. In the absence of clinical signs of anastomotic dehiscence (for example, luminal contents through the drain or wound site/local inflammation; fever (&gt; 38 °C) or leukocytosis (&gt; 10,000/L); leak may also be detected on imaging studies), patients started with sips of water at the day 3 and the oral intake was gradually increased to solid food. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines were used in the postoperative protocol.\nLeak rate 4/40 = 10%\nStricture 10/40 = 25%\nItaly 30 patients (Marano et al., 2023)\nSingle‐lung ventilation is introduced, and the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, tilted 45° compared to the prone position. For both robotic systems, the cart is docked from the right side of the patient. In addition, three robotic ports are put in place as well as two thoracoscopic ports for the assistant. dV®SiTM port layout for this stage has previously been described [24]. It’s worthy of mention that an additional 5 mm port for the assistant is placed between the intercostal spaces (ICS) 6 and 10, along the posterior axillary line. Figure 2 shows the dV®XiTM trocar position (three-arms technique) in a slight U shape: robotic arm#1(R1) for the grasper or the bipolar forceps at the ICS 9, robotic arm#2 (R2) for the 30° down scope at the ICS 6, posterior to the posterior axillary line and robotic arm#3 (R3) for the monopolar cautery hook, the needle driver or the clip applier at the ICS 4, anterior to the scapular rim. Furthermore assistant port #1(A1, 12-mm) is located in the ILC 8, and assistant port #2 (A2, 5 mm) between R2 and R3 at the posterior axillary line. The targeting area is identified at the level of the Azygos arch. A 7–8 mmHg pneumothorax is then induced. Starting at the anterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is cut from the level of the azygos arch down to the diaphragm where the pulmonary ligament is divided. The azygos arch is then sectioned with robotic Weck Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) and a right paratracheal lymphadenectomy is performed. Next, the dissection of the parietal pleura is deepened towards the esophageal hiatus until the aorta becomes exposed. Subsequently, the right vagus nerve is sectioned just below the carina, preserving its bronchial branches. The dissection of the esophagus is extended below the tracheal bifurcation and a Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus to facilitate traction.\nThe dissection of the esophagus is then continued along the pericardium down to the diaphragm and the thoracic duct is clipped with robotic clips. The resection of the esophagus en-bloc with periesophageal, bronchial and subcarinal nodes (stations # 107–111) and the thoracic duct is fully completed from the diaphragm up to the azygos arch. The proximal esophagus is divided using a robotic cautery hook above the level of the azygos vein. At this point, the instruments in R1 and R3 are reversed to be able to carefully pull the esophago-gastric bloc and the gastric conduit up through the hiatus until the marker suture becomes visible. The specimen and conduit thus are disconnected, and the specimen is placed in a plastic bag which will be removed through the enlarged incision of the assistant port. Thereafter, four supportive 4-0 polyglactin 910 (Ethicon Inc. USA) stitches are put in between the mucosae and the muscularis externa layer of the esophagus at the four cardinal points to evert the esophageal mucosae. Next, the proximal esophagus is dilatated using a Foley catheter inflated with 10 cc of sterile water for approximately 2–3 min. After having assessed both gastric conduit and esophageal perfusion with ICG fluorescence, a gastrotomy is performed at the most proximal portion of the conduit, maintaining at least 2 cm of distance from the stapler line. A single-layer robot-sewn esophagogastric anastomosis is performed above the level of the azygos arch with two separate running self-locking barbed sutures (Filbloc® 3/0, Assut Europe, Italy or alternatively V-LocTM 3/0, Medtronic, USA) that run in the same direction from 3 to 9 o’clock. Of note is the fact that, after having applied the first stitch on the posterior wall we customarily pass the needle back below the first stitch to evert the posterior esophageal and gastric layer and improve their visualization. Once the posterior aspect of the anastomosis is complete, a NGT is placed under direct vision inside the stomach distally to the anastomosis, thus accomplishing the closure of anterior surface. Finally, a few tension release stitches are put in between the mediastinal pleura and seromuscular layer of the gastric tube. The anastomosis is checked for intraoperative leaks with methylene blue and a 28-Fr chest drain is inserted via the R1 robotic trocar, posteriorly to anastomosis, with the apex in the upper chest (Video).\nStricture 8/30 = 27%\n\nVagus nerve preservation\nFujita Pulmonary vagus nerve preservation for preserving respiratory function Jpn J Surg 18:31 (Fujita et al., 1988)\nPulmonary vagus nerve preservation during esophagectomy (Weijs et al., 2016)\nSurgical anatomy of esophagus (Weijs et al., 2017)\nMeso-esophagus (Cuesta et al., 2015)\nSupracarinal esophagus (Cuesta et al., 2017)\nTopography of pulmonary vagus nerve (Weijs et al., 2015)\n\n\nUpper mediastinal lymphadenectomy\n??

    "text": "Identification of patients at elevated risk of systemic relapse is critical in the choice of optimal therapy at multiple points in the treatment pathway.\nNeoadjuvant chemoradiation has been demonstrated to be a useful adjunct to surgery in locally-advanced esophageal cancer without radiographic evidence of distant metastasis. Long-term analysis of the CROSS trial demonstrated that the addition of chemoradiation to surgery primarily reduces the risk of locoregional and mixed locoregional and systemic recurrences, but does not reduce the risk of isolated systemic recurrence.\nThere is clearly heterogeneity of tumor sensitivity to chemoradiation, as borne out by the observation from the CROSS trial of trimodality therapy, in which a pathologic complete response was noted in 23% of patients with adenocarcinoma and 49% of patients with squamous cell carcinoma. At the other end of spectrum, 30% of patients treated with trimodality therapy experienced systemic failure by 2 year after completion of treatment.\nAn understanding of the risk of systemic recurrence is crucial for rational decision-making regarding neoadjuvant therapy. Patients at low risk of systemic failure may be best treated with trimodality therapy along the lines of the CROSS trial, while patients at elevated risk of systemic failure may benefit from induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation.\nFor patients who have completed neoadjuvant therapy and had no evidence of metastatic disease on restaging, optimal therapy is to proceed to surgery. The ideal candidates for surgical therapy are those who have persistent local disease but have a low risk of occult metastatic disease.\nFor patients who have clinical evidence of persistent local disease after neoadjuvant therapy, the treatment options are surgery or systemic therapy. In this scenario, the risk of occult metastatic disease would be helpful in treatment decisions.\nFor patients who have had a complete clinical response, as judged by negative endoscopic biopsies and a robust response on imageing, active surveillance is an option. Active surveillance allows the natural history of esophageal cancer to become manifest during a period of regular endoscopy and imaging.\nThe SANO clinical trial (Surgery As Necessary Only) focused on patients with esophageal cancer who had completed chemoradiation and had no evidence of persistent disease on endscopy or imaging. They were randomized to immediate surgery or active surveillance. Active surveillance entailed periodic endoscopy and imaging. Patients found to have an isolated local recurrence were recommended for salvage esophagectomy. The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial with an acceptable survival difference between arms of 15%. Active surveillance was found to be non-inferior to immediate surgery.\nFor patients with a complete clinical response, the treatment options are immediate surgery, systemic chemotherapy, or active surveillance. These choices are again informed by an understanding of the risk of occult metastatic disease. Patients at high risk for systemic disease are likely best treated with systemic chemotherapy, while patients at low risk of systemic disease may ideal candidates for active surveillance, as a number of these patients may be found to have eradication of their disease by chemoradiation and may never need surgery.\nCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a small fractino of circulating cell-free ctDNA or “liquid biopsy” is a promising technology to estimate the risk of systemic disease at multiple points in a patient’s treatment pathway.\nThe presence of circulating, tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma is well established(11–13). In most patients, ctDNA represents a small fraction of the total circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA)(14), and is challenging to detect and quantify. Novel technologies, such as our sequencing approach(15,16), enable detection of these rare tumor mutations in an abundance of normal ccfDNA. Several studies have indicated that ctDNA burden correlates closely with overall disease burden(11,14,17,18). Thus, ctDNA provides a potential “liquid biopsy” that can be used to monitor cancer progression and recurrence during treatment.\n\nInitial diagnosis\nMRD window\nSurveillance\n\n\n\n\nDefize Algorithm\n\n\nRotterdam (Eyck et al., 2023) Detection of circulating tumour DNA after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer. J Pathol 2023; 259: 35–45. Samples taking before, 6 weeks after and 23 weeks after CRT. 29/31 patients had mutations detected on tissue biopsy. 24/31 (77%) had mutations potentially detectable in cfDNA. Pretreatment ctDNA detected in 9 (9/24 = 38%( patients, four of whom had incurable disease progression before surgery (2 prior to ChemoRT and 2 prior to surgery). None of these 9 had a pCR. 6/9 had major residual disease after chemoRT. After ChemoRT, ctDNA was detected in 3 patients (3/24 = 12.5%), two of whom had disease progression. Patients were examined wtih CT and EGD biopsies after ChemoRT as part of the SANO trial. ctDNA did not detect any additional patients with residual disease after ChemoRT. ctDNA analyzed with Thermo Fisher Colon Oncoline kit. \\(\\Rightarrow\\). ctDNA can detect some patients with high-risk disease who are at risk for progression (and should have further staging investigations prior to surgery OR be offered watch/wait), but did not help detect patients after ChemoRT who had residual disease (who would be candidates for salvage esophagectomy)\nMelbourne (Cabalag et al., 2022) 62 patients with adenocarcinoma with tumor-informed approach. 9 genes analyzed with targeted amplicon sequencing. Pre-treatment biopsies showed mutations in 55/62 (63%). ctDNA at baseline in 20/55 (36%). The majority (90%) of patients with detectable ctDNA had either locally advanced tumors, nodal involvement or metastatic disease. In patients with locally advanced tumors, disease free survival (DFS) was more accurately stratified using pre-treatment ctDNA status [HR 4.34 (95% CI 0.93-20.21); P = 0.05] compared to nodal status on PET-CT. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, patients who are node negative but ctDNA positive have inferior DFS [HR 11.71 (95% CI 1.16-118.80) P = 0.04]. In blood samples taken before and following NAT, clearance of ctDNA after NAT was associated with a favourable response to treatment. Furthermore, patients who are ctDNA positive during post-treatment surveillance are at high risk of relapse.\nSan Diego: (Kato et al., 2018) 55 GE adenocarcinoma (mostly advanced disease; 9, surgically resectable) ctDNA with Guardant (49/55) or Foundation. Esophagus =11, GEJ = 17, gastric = 27. Seventy-six percent of patients (42/55) had ≥1 genomic alteration [including variants of unknown significance (VUS)] and 69.1% (38/55) had ≥1 characterized alteration (excluding VUSs). The median number of alterations per patient was 2 (range, 0–15). TP53 (50.9%, 28/55), PIK3CA (16.4%, 9/55), ERBB2 (14.5%, 8/55), and KRAS (14.5%, 8/55) genes were most frequently affected characterized alterations. Thirty-one patients also had tissue NGS. Concordance between tissue and ctDNA ranged from 61.3% (TP53 alterations) to 87.1% (KRAS alterations). ERBB2 alterations were significantly associated with poor overall survival (HR, 14.06; 95% confidence interval, 2.44–81.03; P = 0.003 multivariate analysis). Among patients with ≥1 alteration, no 2 patients had identical molecular portfolios.\nStanford: (Azad et al., 2020): 45 patients receving chemoradiation for esophageal cancer. ctDNA analysis with deep squencing. Tumor-derived DNA represented 0.07% of all cell-free DNA. Detection of ctDNA following chemoradiotherapy was associated with tumor progression (hazard ratio, 18.7; P&lt;.0001), formation of distant metastases (hazard ratio, 32.1; P&lt;.0001), and shorter disease-specific survival times (hazard ratio, 23.1; P&lt;. 0001). A higher proportion of patients with tumor progression had new mutations detected in plasma samples collected after chemoradiotherapy than patients without progression (P=.03). Detection of ctDNA after chemoradiotherapy preceded radiographic evidence of tumor progression by an average of 2.8 months. Among patients who received chemoradiotherapy without surgery, combined ctDNA and metabolic imaging analysis predicted progression in 100% of patients with tumor progression, compared with 71% for only ctDNA detection and 57% for only metabolic imaging analysis. Before ChemoRT, ctDNA detected in 27/45 = 60%. After ChemoRT, ctDNA detected in 5/31 = 16%.\nZaanan A, Didelot A, Broudin C, et al. Longitudinal circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis during treatment (Tx) of locally advanced resectable (LAR) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) adenocarcinoma (ADENOCA): the PLAGAST prospective biomarker study.

During MRD interval, 23 patients had sampled drawn during the MRD window, of whom 3 had detectable ctDNA with 2/3 recurrences compared with 3/20 (15% among those with negative ctDNA. ctDNA detected during MRD window was associated with shorter disease-free survival (HR 6.2 p=0.049). 32 patients were studied during surveillance, of whom 5/5 (100%) recurred in those with positive ctDNA and 2/27 (7.4%) among ct-DNA negative.\nCRITICS trial (leal525?) identified post-neoadjuvant therapy or preoperative ctDNA as a predictive biomarker for pathological response (according to Mandard’s tumour regression grading [TRG] system0, with ctDNA analyses being consistent with TRG in 30 (70%) of 43 patients (p=0·03; Fisher’s exact test).\nIn the initial analysis of the PLAGAST study postoperative, tumour-informed ctDNA persistence was related to recurrence and overall survival. Additionally, the clearance of ctDNA after medical treatment could serve as a predictor of outcomes.\nin the metastatic setting, Kelly and colleagues observed in a phase 1–2 study a statistical correlation between mutation variant allele frequencies and overall response rate to ICIs in metastatic oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Patients with a decrease in variant allele frequencies at week 9 had a longer median OS (3.8 months, 95% CI 7·0–NR) than those with an increase in variant allele frequencies (8.2 months, 6·2–NR; HR 0·07, 95% CI 0·01–0·66).74 However, false-negative ctDNA results have been reported in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, restricting the utility of ctDNA as the sole predictive biomarker for oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma.\nRochester and Pittsburgh (Egyud et al., 2019) Tumor-informed detection of ctDNA within patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. Percentage of patients with detectable ctDNA increased with tumor stage. For patients with stage I or II disease, ctDNA was present in less than 50%, limiting its ability to detect esophageal cancer at an early stage.\nChidambaram S, Markar SR. Clinical utility and applicability of circulating tumor DNA testing in esophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Dis Esophagus. 2022;35:doab046.\n(Huffman et al., 2022) ctDNA levels were analyzed in the preoperative, postoperative, and surveillance settings in patients with EGC using a personalized multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based next-generation sequencing assay. Plasma samples (n = 943) from 295 patients at &gt; 70 institutions were collected before surgery, postoperatively, and/or serially during routine clinical follow-up from September 19, 2019, to February 21, 2022. A total of 295 patients with EGC were analyzed, and 212 patients with stages I-III disease were further explored. Pretreatment ctDNA was detected in 96% (23/24) of patients with preoperative time points. Postoperative ctDNA was detected in 23.5% (16/68) of patients with stage I-III EGC within 16 weeks (molecular residual disease window) after surgery without receiving systemic therapy. ctDNA detection at any time point after surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 23.6; 95% CI, 10.2 to 66.0; P &lt; .0001), within the molecular residual disease window (HR, 10.7; 95% CI, 4.3 to 29.3; P &lt; .0001), and during the surveillance period (HR, 17.7; 95% CI, 7.3 to 50.7; P &lt; .0001) was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival. In multivariable analysis, ctDNA status and clinical stage of disease were independently associated with outcomes. 125 patients with stage I–III oesophagogastric cancers were analysed at any timepoint postoperatively (regardless of adjuvant treatment). The median recurrence-free survival was not reached in patients negative for ctDNA, whereas it was 9·6 months in patients positive for ctDNA (HR 23·6, 95% CI 10·2–66·0; p=0·0001). These results were observed irrespective of the anatomical localisation of the tumour. Recurrence rates were 5% in patients negative for ctDNA and 88% in patients positive for ctDNA. The patient population enrolled in this study was heterogeneous and further prospective studies are required.\nCopenhagen (Iden et al., 2025): Patients with resectable gastric and GEJ AC, undergoing perioperative chemotherapy and surgery, were prospectively enrolled. Serial plasma samples were collected at baseline, after one cycle of chemotherapy, after preoperative chemotherapy, and after surgery. ctDNA was assessed by a ddPCR test (TriMeth), which targets the gastrointestinal cancer-specific methylation patterns of the genes C9orf50, KCNQ5, and CLIP4.\nResults: ctDNA analysis was performed on 229 plasma samples from 86 patients. At baseline, ctDNA was detected in 56% of patients, which decreased to 37% following one cycle of chemotherapy, 25% after preoperative chemotherapy and 15% after surgical resection. The presence of ctDNA after one cycle of chemotherapy was associated with reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR = 2.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-4.85, p = 0.005) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.07-4.62, p = 0.032). Similarly, ctDNA after surgery was associated with significantly shorter RFS (HR = 6.22, 95% CI 2.39-16.2, p &lt; 0.001) and OS (HR = 6.37, 95% CI 2.10-19.3, p = 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis confirmed ctDNA after surgery as an independent prognostic factor (p &lt; 0.001).\nWo JY, Clark JW, Eyler CE, Mino-Kenudson M, Klempner SJ, Allen JN, et al. Results and molecular correlates from a pilot study of neoadjuvant induction FOLFIRINOX followed by chemoradiation and surgery for gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas.

The mediastinum is entered and the Penrose drain is retrieved and used for retraction to dissect the distal esophagus. Station 8 lymph does are removed and/or dissected in such a way that they are removed with the specimen.\n\n\nDissection of mid-esophagus and station 7/8/10 lymph nodes. The mid-esophagus is dissected from the airway with precise application of energy. Station 7, 8, and 10 lymph nodes are removed.\n\n\nDivision of azygous vein, dissection of upper esophagus, station 2/4 nodal dissection. The azygous vein is divided with a vascular stapler cartridge and the upper esophagus is dissected. A paratracheal nodal dissection is completed.\n\n7.Completion of conduit and removal of specimen. The conduit is delivered into the thorax and it is separated from the specimen with green staple cartridges. This is done using a laparoscopic graster. Stomach is pulled into the chest until the Vicryl marker suture is seen. The specimen is removed through the assistant port incision. An Alexis port is used to seal the extraction site.\n\nDivision of esophagus just above level of azygous vein. ICG can be used to check perfusion.\n\nCircular stapled anastomosis\nLarge needle driver to grasp anvil\nCamera moved back to Port 3 (from 2) to visualize anastomosis better \nPort #1 may need to be remove for visibiity\nIntact minor gastric curvature of the transected specimen is brought out of the chest through the mini-thoracotomy. To insert the circular staper handle the stomach conduit is opene by incision the stapler line previusly created at the antrum in the minor curvaturell. The incision is made in the distal third of the antrum to introduce the stapler handle as far away from the gastro-esophageal crossing and allow a large distance to the grea\n\nHand-sewn Anastomosis\nPosterior running 4-0 Stratafix running posterior wall\n\n\nConduit and esophagus opened anterior to staple lines, which are incorporated into the staple line. Take care to ensure incision length is the same on conduit vs esophagus.\nNext the lumen of the esophagus is held up with a Cadiere Forceps by the da Vinci, while the assistant exposes the gastric tube in order to minimize the tension on the tissue . The second layer of the back wall is created by a running Stratafix Spiral® 3-0 (SH) suture placed transmural. The suture is started dorsally (9 o’clock position) and continued to ventrally (3o’clock) via the 6 o’clock position with the needle inside-out on the esophagus and outside-in on the gastric conduit. The knot is placed extraluminally.\n\n\nThe anterior front wall is closed with 2 Stratafix Spiral 3-0 sutures starting one each at the dorsal and ventral edge of the remaining opening. The first suture is started dorsally (9 o’clock) and run to the middle of the opening at 12 o’clock. The second suture is run from ventrally 3 o´clock finishing ventral at 12 o´clock, meeting the first suture line. The securing knot is placed extraluminally.\n\nThe previously mobilized mediastinal pleura is closed with either single stitches or a running suture on top of anastomosis starting at azygos stump for about 4 cm distal, and pulling in small piece of omentum for protection. This enables fixation of the gastric tube and reinforcement of the anastomosis."

    "section": "Hand-sewn Anastomosis RAMIE",
    "text": "Hand-sewn Anastomosis RAMIE\nItaly (Huscher et al., 2023) 40 patients over 4 years\nAll patients underwent a fast-track surgical protocol. The Da Vinci ® Si robotic system was positioned perpendicular to the patient’s right side and docked to the trocars. For the abdominal part of the procedure, the patient was positioned in a supine position. The four robotic trocars were placed in a horizontal line at or above the umbilicus (Fig. 1). In the abdomen, CO2 insufflation with 14 mmHg of pressure was used. Targeting to the stomach was performed. The surgical assistant was located on the left side of the table. A tip-up fenestrated grasper in trocar 1 was used to elevate the left lobe of the liver and for certain retraction movements during the abdominal part. The fenestrated bipolar forceps were used in the 12-mm trocar (no. 2) with a reduction cartridge, and later the 12-mm trocar was used for the robotic Endo Wrist ® stapler 45 mm to form the gastric conduit, beginning from the lesser curvature near the crow foot and continued towards the fundus, parallel to the greater curvature. After the abdominal dissection and creation of the conduit for reconstruction, Indocyanine Green (ICG) test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of the gastric conduit. For the thoracic part of the procedure (Fig. 2), the patient was positioned in a prone position (the operation table was tilted 19° towards the prone) and three robotic trocars and one laparoscopic trocar were inserted on the right chest. A single-lumen tube was used for intubation and the right lung was not deflated and disconnected from ventilation. In the chest, CO2 insufflation with 8 mmHg of pressure was enough to obtain an optimal working volume. The pulmonary ligament was divided. Hereafter, the parietal pleura was dissected at the anterior side of the esophagus from the diaphragm, up to the azygos vein. The azygos vein was ligated with Hem-o-lok and divided. At the posterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is dissected cranially to caudally along the azygos vein, including the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct was clipped with a 10-mm endoclip. To facilitate esophagus mobilization, a Penrose drain was placed around the esophagus to manipulate the esophagus for further mobilization. The thoracic esophagus was mobilized and transected at the level of the azygos vein. The esophagus was resected en bloc with the surrounding mediastinal lymph nodes. The resected specimen will contain right-side paratracheal (station 2R), tracheobronchial (station 4), aortopulmonary window (station 5), carinal (station 7), and periesophageal (station 8) lymph nodes. The reconstruction time started with the anchoring of the gastric conduit to the esophageal stump with two 3–0 silk stay sutures. The conduit was opened on the anterior wall by the adoption of a monopolar hook. An end-to-side roboticsewn anastomosis was created by the adoption of two 3–0 running barbed sutures (V-loc – Medtronic, USA – Fig. 3).11, 12 After completion of the anterior wall, a nasogastric tube was passed through the half-completed anastomosis. Once the anastomosis was completed, 3–0 silk interrupted sutures were placed circumferentially to reinforce it (Fig. 4; Video). Before and after anastomosis fashioning, an ICG test was performed to evaluate adequate perfusion of conduit. In addition, the conduit cul-de-sac was suspended at the posterior thoracic wall by two stitches. The specimen was extracted through a small thoracotomy and a right-sided chest tube was placed. No postoperative swallow tests were performed. In the absence of clinical signs of anastomotic dehiscence (for example, luminal contents through the drain or wound site/local inflammation; fever (&gt; 38 °C) or leukocytosis (&gt; 10,000/L); leak may also be detected on imaging studies), patients started with sips of water at the day 3 and the oral intake was gradually increased to solid food. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) guidelines were used in the postoperative protocol.\nLeak rate 4/40 = 10%\nStricture 10/40 = 25%\nItaly 30 patients (Marano et al., 2023)\nSingle‐lung ventilation is introduced, and the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, tilted 45° compared to the prone position. For both robotic systems, the cart is docked from the right side of the patient. In addition, three robotic ports are put in place as well as two thoracoscopic ports for the assistant. dV®SiTM port layout for this stage has previously been described [24]. It’s worthy of mention that an additional 5 mm port for the assistant is placed between the intercostal spaces (ICS) 6 and 10, along the posterior axillary line. Figure 2 shows the dV®XiTM trocar position (three-arms technique) in a slight U shape: robotic arm#1(R1) for the grasper or the bipolar forceps at the ICS 9, robotic arm#2 (R2) for the 30° down scope at the ICS 6, posterior to the posterior axillary line and robotic arm#3 (R3) for the monopolar cautery hook, the needle driver or the clip applier at the ICS 4, anterior to the scapular rim. Furthermore assistant port #1(A1, 12-mm) is located in the ILC 8, and assistant port #2 (A2, 5 mm) between R2 and R3 at the posterior axillary line. The targeting area is identified at the level of the Azygos arch. A 7–8 mmHg pneumothorax is then induced. Starting at the anterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is cut from the level of the azygos arch down to the diaphragm where the pulmonary ligament is divided. The azygos arch is then sectioned with robotic Weck Hem-o-lok clips (Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) and a right paratracheal lymphadenectomy is performed. Next, the dissection of the parietal pleura is deepened towards the esophageal hiatus until the aorta becomes exposed. Subsequently, the right vagus nerve is sectioned just below the carina, preserving its bronchial branches. The dissection of the esophagus is extended below the tracheal bifurcation and a Penrose drain is placed around the esophagus to facilitate traction.\nThe dissection of the esophagus is then continued along the pericardium down to the diaphragm and the thoracic duct is clipped with robotic clips. The resection of the esophagus en-bloc with periesophageal, bronchial and subcarinal nodes (stations # 107–111) and the thoracic duct is fully completed from the diaphragm up to the azygos arch. The proximal esophagus is divided using a robotic cautery hook above the level of the azygos vein. At this point, the instruments in R1 and R3 are reversed to be able to carefully pull the esophago-gastric bloc and the gastric conduit up through the hiatus until the marker suture becomes visible. The specimen and conduit thus are disconnected, and the specimen is placed in a plastic bag which will be removed through the enlarged incision of the assistant port. Thereafter, four supportive 4-0 polyglactin 910 (Ethicon Inc. USA) stitches are put in between the mucosae and the muscularis externa layer of the esophagus at the four cardinal points to evert the esophageal mucosae. Next, the proximal esophagus is dilatated using a Foley catheter inflated with 10 cc of sterile water for approximately 2–3 min. After having assessed both gastric conduit and esophageal perfusion with ICG fluorescence, a gastrotomy is performed at the most proximal portion of the conduit, maintaining at least 2 cm of distance from the stapler line. A single-layer robot-sewn esophagogastric anastomosis is performed above the level of the azygos arch with two separate running self-locking barbed sutures (Filbloc® 3/0, Assut Europe, Italy or alternatively V-LocTM 3/0, Medtronic, USA) that run in the same direction from 3 to 9 o’clock. Of note is the fact that, after having applied the first stitch on the posterior wall we customarily pass the needle back below the first stitch to evert the posterior esophageal and gastric layer and improve their visualization. Once the posterior aspect of the anastomosis is complete, a NGT is placed under direct vision inside the stomach distally to the anastomosis, thus accomplishing the closure of anterior surface. Finally, a few tension release stitches are put in between the mediastinal pleura and seromuscular layer of the gastric tube. The anastomosis is checked for intraoperative leaks with methylene blue and a 28-Fr chest drain is inserted via the R1 robotic trocar, posteriorly to anastomosis, with the apex in the upper chest (Video).\nStricture 8/30 = 27%"

In general, a 25mm size is selected, unless the patient has particularly small frame, in which case a 21mm size is used. Two stay sutures of 2-0 silk on RB-1 needles are placed in the center of the esophageal staple line 3mm apart. A Harmonic scalpel is used to divide the staple line. The OrVil device is passed through the mouth and is passed through the fenestration in the staple line. The anvil portion of the OrVil is oriented so that the rounded portion is placed against the roof of the mouth. The OrVil is guided into the hypopharynx by pulling on the the tube end of the device. As the anvil approaches the hypopharynx, the jaw is pulled forward to allow passage of the anvil.\nThe shaft of the anvil is brought through the esophageal staple line, and the tube disconnected from the anvil by cutting the blue sutures.\nThe superior end of the conduit is opened along the staple line and the DST XL stapler (matching the diameter of the OrVil) introduced through the Alexis device (Port #2). The stapler shaft is placed into the open end of the gastric conduit and the conduit pulled over it (‘sock over shoe’). The stapler spike is brought out through the greater curvature. The anvil is grasped with a Maryland grasper placed through a superior 5mm port and the two components of the stapler are mated and the stapler tightened and fired. The knob of the stapler is rotated two turns counter-clockwise until a click is felt, at which time the anvil will flip. The stapler is withdrawn and the donuts examined and sent for pathologic exam.\nThe anastomosis is completed by firing a 60mm Blue load across the conduit cephalad to the anastomosis. The excess conduit is retrieved through the Alexis port and sent for pathologic exam as ‘additional gastric margin.’"

    "text": "ctDNA in Esophageal Cancer\nIdentification of patients at elevated risk of systemic relapse is critical in the choice of optimal therapy at multiple points in the treatment pathway.\nNeoadjuvant chemoradiation has been demonstrated to be a useful adjunct to surgery in locally-advanced esophageal cancer without radiographic evidence of distant metastasis. Long-term analysis of the CROSS trial demonstrated that the addition of chemoradiation to surgery primarily reduces the risk of locoregional and mixed locoregional and systemic recurrences, but does not reduce the risk of isolated systemic recurrence.\nThere is clearly heterogeneity of tumor sensitivity to chemoradiation, as borne out by the observation from the CROSS trial of trimodality therapy, in which a pathologic complete response was noted in 23% of patients with adenocarcinoma and 49% of patients with squamous cell carcinoma. At the other end of spectrum, 30% of patients treated with trimodality therapy experienced systemic failure by 2 year after completion of treatment.\nAn understanding of the risk of systemic recurrence is crucial for rational decision-making regarding neoadjuvant therapy. Patients at low risk of systemic failure may be best treated with trimodality therapy along the lines of the CROSS trial, while patients at elevated risk of systemic failure may benefit from induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation.\nFor patients who have completed neoadjuvant therapy and had no evidence of metastatic disease on restaging, optimal therapy is to proceed to surgery. The ideal candidates for surgical therapy are those who have persistent local disease but have a low risk of occult metastatic disease.\nFor patients who have clinical evidence of persistent local disease after neoadjuvant therapy, the treatment options are surgery or systemic therapy. In this scenario, the risk of occult metastatic disease would be helpful in treatment decisions.\nFor patients who have had a complete clinical response, as judged by negative endoscopic biopsies and a robust response on imageing, active surveillance is an option. Active surveillance allows the natural history of esophageal cancer to become manifest during a period of regular endoscopy and imaging.\nThe SANO clinical trial (Surgery As Necessary Only) focused on patients with esophageal cancer who had completed chemoradiation and had no evidence of persistent disease on endscopy or imaging. They were randomized to immediate surgery or active surveillance. Active surveillance entailed periodic endoscopy and imaging. Patients found to have an isolated local recurrence were recommended for salvage esophagectomy. The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial with an acceptable survival difference between arms of 15%. Active surveillance was found to be non-inferior to immediate surgery.\nFor patients with a complete clinical response, the treatment options are immediate surgery, systemic chemotherapy, or active surveillance. These choices are again informed by an understanding of the risk of occult metastatic disease. Patients at high risk for systemic disease are likely best treated with systemic chemotherapy, while patients at low risk of systemic disease may ideal candidates for active surveillance, as a number of these patients may be found to have eradication of their disease by chemoradiation and may never need surgery.\nCirculating tumor DNA (ctDNA) represents a small fractino of circulating cell-free ctDNA or “liquid biopsy” is a promising technology to estimate the risk of systemic disease at multiple points in a patient’s treatment pathway.\nThe presence of circulating, tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma is well established(11–13). In most patients, ctDNA represents a small fraction of the total circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA)(14), and is challenging to detect and quantify. Novel technologies, such as our sequencing approach(15,16), enable detection of these rare tumor mutations in an abundance of normal ccfDNA. Several studies have indicated that ctDNA burden correlates closely with overall disease burden(11,14,17,18). Thus, ctDNA provides a potential “liquid biopsy” that can be used to monitor cancer progression and recurrence during treatment.\n\nInitial diagnosis\nMRD window\nSurveillance\n\n\nDefize AlgorithmRotterdam (Eyck et al., 2023) Detection of circulating tumour DNA after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced oesophageal cancer. J Pathol 2023; 259: 35–45. Samples taking before, 6 weeks after and 23 weeks after CRT. 29/31 patients had mutations detected on tissue biopsy. 24/31 (77%) had mutations potentially detectable in cfDNA. Pretreatment ctDNA detected in 9 (9/24 = 38%( patients, four of whom had incurable disease progression before surgery (2 prior to ChemoRT and 2 prior to surgery). None of these 9 had a pCR. 6/9 had major residual disease after chemoRT. After ChemoRT, ctDNA was detected in 3 patients (3/24 = 12.5%), two of whom had disease progression. Patients were examined wtih CT and EGD biopsies after ChemoRT as part of the SANO trial. ctDNA did not detect any additional patients with residual disease after ChemoRT. ctDNA analyzed with Thermo Fisher Colon Oncoline kit. \\(\\Rightarrow\\). ctDNA can detect some patients with high-risk disease who are at risk for progression (and should have further staging investigations prior to surgery OR be offered watch/wait), but did not help detect patients after ChemoRT who had residual disease (who would be candidates for salvage esophagectomy)\nMelbourne (Cabalag et al., 2022) 62 patients with adenocarcinoma with tumor-informed approach. 9 genes analyzed with targeted amplicon sequencing. Pre-treatment biopsies showed mutations in 55/62 (63%). ctDNA at baseline in 20/55 (36%). The majority (90%) of patients with detectable ctDNA had either locally advanced tumors, nodal involvement or metastatic disease. In patients with locally advanced tumors, disease free survival (DFS) was more accurately stratified using pre-treatment ctDNA status [HR 4.34 (95% CI 0.93-20.21); P = 0.05] compared to nodal status on PET-CT. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, patients who are node negative but ctDNA positive have inferior DFS [HR 11.71 (95% CI 1.16-118.80) P = 0.04]. In blood samples taken before and following NAT, clearance of ctDNA after NAT was associated with a favourable response to treatment. Furthermore, patients who are ctDNA positive during post-treatment surveillance are at high risk of relapse.\nSan Diego: (Kato et al., 2018) 55 GE adenocarcinoma (mostly advanced disease; 9, surgically resectable) ctDNA with Guardant (49/55) or Foundation. Esophagus =11, GEJ = 17, gastric = 27. Seventy-six percent of patients (42/55) had ≥1 genomic alteration [including variants of unknown significance (VUS)] and 69.1% (38/55) had ≥1 characterized alteration (excluding VUSs). The median number of alterations per patient was 2 (range, 0–15). TP53 (50.9%, 28/55), PIK3CA (16.4%, 9/55), ERBB2 (14.5%, 8/55), and KRAS (14.5%, 8/55) genes were most frequently affected characterized alterations. Thirty-one patients also had tissue NGS. Concordance between tissue and ctDNA ranged from 61.3% (TP53 alterations) to 87.1% (KRAS alterations). ERBB2 alterations were significantly associated with poor overall survival (HR, 14.06; 95% confidence interval, 2.44–81.03; P = 0.003 multivariate analysis). Among patients with ≥1 alteration, no 2 patients had identical molecular portfolios.\nStanford: (Azad et al., 2020): 45 patients receving chemoradiation for esophageal cancer. ctDNA analysis with deep squencing.

Detection of ctDNA following chemoradiotherapy was associated with tumor progression (hazard ratio, 18.7; P&lt;.0001), formation of distant metastases (hazard ratio, 32.1; P&lt;.0001), and shorter disease-specific survival times (hazard ratio, 23.1; P&lt;. 0001). A higher proportion of patients with tumor progression had new mutations detected in plasma samples collected after chemoradiotherapy than patients without progression (P=.03). Detection of ctDNA after chemoradiotherapy preceded radiographic evidence of tumor progression by an average of 2.8 months. Among patients who received chemoradiotherapy without surgery, combined ctDNA and metabolic imaging analysis predicted progression in 100% of patients with tumor progression, compared with 71% for only ctDNA detection and 57% for only metabolic imaging analysis. Before ChemoRT, ctDNA detected in 27/45 = 60%. After ChemoRT, ctDNA detected in 5/31 = 16%.\nZaanan A, Didelot A, Broudin C, et al. Longitudinal circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis during treatment (Tx) of locally advanced resectable (LAR) gastric or gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) adenocarcinoma (ADENOCA): the PLAGAST prospective biomarker study. J Clin Oncol 2024; 42: 4028 (abstract).\nctDNA in patients with pCR or near-pCR after chemoRT + surgery for esophageal cancer (Lander et al., 2024). 42 patients (309 samples) taken during 16-week MRD interval and during surveillance and analyzed with Signatera. During MRD interval, 23 patients had sampled drawn during the MRD window, of whom 3 had detectable ctDNA with 2/3 recurrences compared with 3/20 (15% among those with negative ctDNA. ctDNA detected during MRD window was associated with shorter disease-free survival (HR 6.2 p=0.049). 32 patients were studied during surveillance, of whom 5/5 (100%) recurred in those with positive ctDNA and 2/27 (7.4%) among ct-DNA negative.\nCRITICS trial (leal525?) identified post-neoadjuvant therapy or preoperative ctDNA as a predictive biomarker for pathological response (according to Mandard’s tumour regression grading [TRG] system0, with ctDNA analyses being consistent with TRG in 30 (70%) of 43 patients (p=0·03; Fisher’s exact test).\nIn the initial analysis of the PLAGAST study postoperative, tumour-informed ctDNA persistence was related to recurrence and overall survival. Additionally, the clearance of ctDNA after medical treatment could serve as a predictor of outcomes.\nin the metastatic setting, Kelly and colleagues observed in a phase 1–2 study a statistical correlation between mutation variant allele frequencies and overall response rate to ICIs in metastatic oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma. Patients with a decrease in variant allele frequencies at week 9 had a longer median OS (3.8 months, 95% CI 7·0–NR) than those with an increase in variant allele frequencies (8.2 months, 6·2–NR; HR 0·07, 95% CI 0·01–0·66).74 However, false-negative ctDNA results have been reported in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, restricting the utility of ctDNA as the sole predictive biomarker for oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma.\nRochester and Pittsburgh (Egyud et al., 2019) Tumor-informed detection of ctDNA within patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. Percentage of patients with detectable ctDNA increased with tumor stage. For patients with stage I or II disease, ctDNA was present in less than 50%, limiting its ability to detect esophageal cancer at an early stage.\nChidambaram S, Markar SR. Clinical utility and applicability of circulating tumor DNA testing in esophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Dis Esophagus. 2022;35:doab046.\n(Huffman et al., 2022) ctDNA levels were analyzed in the preoperative, postoperative, and surveillance settings in patients with EGC using a personalized multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based next-generation sequencing assay. Plasma samples (n = 943) from 295 patients at &gt; 70 institutions were collected before surgery, postoperatively, and/or serially during routine clinical follow-up from September 19, 2019, to February 21, 2022. A total of 295 patients with EGC were analyzed, and 212 patients with stages I-III disease were further explored. Pretreatment ctDNA was detected in 96% (23/24) of patients with preoperative time points. Postoperative ctDNA was detected in 23.5% (16/68) of patients with stage I-III EGC within 16 weeks (molecular residual disease window) after surgery without receiving systemic therapy. ctDNA detection at any time point after surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 23.6; 95% CI, 10.2 to 66.0; P &lt; .0001), within the molecular residual disease window (HR, 10.7; 95% CI, 4.3 to 29.3; P &lt; .0001), and during the surveillance period (HR, 17.7; 95% CI, 7.3 to 50.7; P &lt; .0001) was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival. In multivariable analysis, ctDNA status and clinical stage of disease were independently associated with outcomes. 125 patients with stage I–III oesophagogastric cancers were analysed at any timepoint postoperatively (regardless of adjuvant treatment). The median recurrence-free survival was not reached in patients negative for ctDNA, whereas it was 9·6 months in patients positive for ctDNA (HR 23·6, 95% CI 10·2–66·0; p=0·0001). These results were observed irrespective of the anatomical localisation of the tumour. Recurrence rates were 5% in patients negative for ctDNA and 88% in patients positive for ctDNA. The patient population enrolled in this study was heterogeneous and further prospective studies are required.\nCopenhagen (Iden et al., 2025): Patients with resectable gastric and GEJ AC, undergoing perioperative chemotherapy and surgery, were prospectively enrolled. Serial plasma samples were collected at baseline, after one cycle of chemotherapy, after preoperative chemotherapy, and after surgery. ctDNA was assessed by a ddPCR test (TriMeth), which targets the gastrointestinal cancer-specific methylation patterns of the genes C9orf50, KCNQ5, and CLIP4.\nResults: ctDNA analysis was performed on 229 plasma samples from 86 patients. At baseline, ctDNA was detected in 56% of patients, which decreased to 37% following one cycle of chemotherapy, 25% after preoperative chemotherapy and 15% after surgical resection. The presence of ctDNA after one cycle of chemotherapy was associated with reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR = 2.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-4.85, p = 0.005) and overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.07-4.62, p = 0.032). Similarly, ctDNA after surgery was associated with significantly shorter RFS (HR = 6.22, 95% CI 2.39-16.2, p &lt; 0.001) and OS (HR = 6.37, 95% CI 2.10-19.3, p = 0.001). Multivariable regression analysis confirmed ctDNA after surgery as an independent prognostic factor (p &lt; 0.001).\nWo JY, Clark JW, Eyler CE, Mino-Kenudson M, Klempner SJ, Allen JN, et al. Results and molecular correlates from a pilot study of neoadjuvant induction FOLFIRINOX followed by chemoradiation and surgery for gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas.
