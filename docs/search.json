Preoperative evaluation should include history of weight loss, dysphagia, odynophagia. Nutrition support from has been suggested to improve outcomes after esophagectomy in retrospective studies.(Ligthart-Melis et al. 2013) ESPN (ASPEN?) guidelines suggest strategies for nutritional support in cancer patients.(Arends et al. 2017)\n1 - No weight loss\n2 - 5% weight loss and moderate\n3 - 10% weight loss and severe dysphagia\nDysphagia score\n\n\n\nFeeding jejunostomy is the traditional approach to enteral tube placement in patients who may undergo surgery in the future. Gastrostomy placement, particularly via the endoscopic approach (PEG) runs the risk of damage to the right gastroepiploic vascular arcade, which might devascularize a future gastric conduit, although small series suggest that this risk is low (Margolis et al. 2003)\nAnecdotal data suggests that esophagectommy with gastric conduit can safely be performed after gastrostomy, particularly if placement is done via laparoscopy and if the tube can be removed prior to esophagectomy to allow the tract to heal. PEG placement (via endoscopy) runs a small but finite risk of seeding of the gastrostomy tract with tumor.(Ellrichmann et al. 2013)\nFrailty (Fried et al. 2004) Clinical Frailty Score (7-point) predicts death and need for institutional care at 5 years from Canadian Health study (Rockwood et al. 2005) Frailty and major surgery (McIsaac, Bryson, and van Walraven 2016) (Mosquera, Spaniolas, and Fitzgerald 2016)\n\n\n\nCardiopulmonary testing has not been shown to be of proven value in peroperative assement of surgical fitness prior to esophagectomy (Drummond et al. 2018)\n6minute walk test inoue ito kanda niwa nagaya nishida Dis Esophagus\nreview of CPT\n(Older, Hall, and Hader 1999) hall hader 1999\nShuttle walk and CPT in esophagectomy (Whibley et al. 2018)\nRoutine pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy fitness testing is not indicated for oesophagogastric cancer surgery.

Improvement seen in six-minute walk test, but no difference in complications or operative mortality.\non the return of functional activity after a major surgical procedure. Hence, efforts to optimize functional capacity prior to surgery have shown improved outcomes for some abdominal and oncologic surgeries [20]. A multimodal approach termed as ‘prehabilitation’ comprising nutritional supplementation, psychological counselling, medical optimization, and a structured exercise program involving both aerobic and strengthening activity has been proposed to improve outcomes [21]. Respiratory optimization with deep breathing exercises, spirometry, and inspiratory muscle training decreases pulmonary complications [22]. Studies have shown that prehabilitation reduces anxiety, depression and fatigue, and improves the quality of life [23]. Preliminary results from a recently concluded study [24] on prehabilitation for esophageal surgery demonstrated improvement in functional capacity; however, the impact on postoperative outcomes needs to be evaluated by further ongoing studies [25]. Extrapolation from studies on other abdominal surgeries [20] suggests that at least 4 weeks of preoperative prehabilitation is better than postoperative rehabilitation to influence outcomes. As most patients with operable esophageal cancer would receive neoadjuvant treatment, it would be opportunistic to use this preoperative window to initiate prehabilitation.\nA feasibility trial of prehabilitation before oesophagogastric cancer surgery using a multi-component home-based exercise programme: the ChemoFit study.
