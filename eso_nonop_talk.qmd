## CROSS: Locally-advanced Esophageal Cancer

-   368 esophageal cancer patients randomized:
    -   Surgery alone
    -   Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery
-   75% adenocarcinoma
-   age $\tilde{x}$=60
-   longer survival with Chemo+RT $\rightarrow$ Surgery

## CROSS: Pathologic Complete Response

Adenocarcinoma: pCR in 23%

Squamous cell carcinoma: pCR in 49%

$\Rightarrow$ Can some patients be spared surgery?

## CROSS

The median time from randomization until resection was 24 days in the surgery group and 97 days in the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group. Of note, 13% of patients in the surgery only group were found to be unresectable at the time of operation versus 4% of the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group (p = 0.002). R0 resection was obtained in 92% of the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group versus 69% of the surgery alone group (p \< 0.001). There were no significant differences in complications between the two groups, including in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Positive nodes were identified in 75% of the surgery alone group versus 31% of the chemoradiotherapy-surgery group (p \< 0.001).

## SANO (Surgery As Necessary Only)

776 Patient with esophageal cancer treated with chemoRT

Clinical response evaluation after chemoRT

274 with Complete Clinical Response (35%) randomized:

-   156 Active Surveillance ($\rightarrow$ Surgery for local recurrence)
-   118 Surgery

## SANO Clinical Respone Evaluation

EGD at 6 weeks with bite-on-bite biopsies

Second evaluation at 12 weeks if first biopsies negative:

-   PET
-   EUS-FNA of suspected lymph nodes
-   EGD with bite-on-bite biopsies

## Clinical Response Evaluation

761 First Clinical Response Evaluation (EGD)

-   232 Isolated local disease documented by biopsy
-   40 Persistent stricture
-   2 metastatic disease

## Clinical Response Evaluation

761 First Clinical Response Evaluation (EGD)

-   232 Isolated local disease documented by biopsy
-   40 Persistent stricture
-   2 metastatic disease

420 Second Clinical Response Evaluation (EGD+PET+FNA)

-   115 Isolated local disease documented by biopsy
-   19 Persistent stricture
-   40 metastatic disease

$\Rightarrow$ 274 with clinical complete response (cCR)

## Clinical Response Evaluation

761 First Clinical Response Evaluation (EGD)

-   232 Isolated local disease
-   40 Persistent stricture
-   2 metastatic disease

420 Second Clinical Response Evaluation (EGD+PET+FNA)

-   **115 Isolated local disease** (missed at first EGD)
-   19 Persistent stricture
-   40 metastatic disease

$\Rightarrow$ 115 Patient had local disease missed at first EGD

## Persistent disease

Surgery performed with two weeks in patients without metastatic disease and:

-   Positive EGD biopsies
-   High-grade dysplasia on EGD
-   Stricture which prohibited passage of scope

## Subsequent Evaluation

-   Every 3 months in first year
-   Every 4 months in Year 2
-   Every 6 months in Year 3
-   Annually Years 4 and 5

## Active Surveillance Outcomes (n=198)

33 (17%) developed metastatic disease - 22 detected at 6 months (third clinical response evaluation)

69 (35%) had persistent complete clinical response

96 (48%) had isolated local recurrence

## Results

![](images/sano_2a.png) No difference in overall survival at median followup of 38 months Median survival 34 months for active surveillance and 50 months for surgery

## SANO - Key Points

Active Surveillance was non-inferior using predefined criteria

-   Non-inferior was defined as survival difference \<15%

Disease-free and Overall survival was numerically better with immediate surgery

Survival curves appear to cross at 2 years favoring immediate surgery

Outcomes were not stratified by histology

## Proposed Pathway Changes

Active Surveillance is a reasonable option in informed patients

Clinical response evaluation should consist of:

-   EGD at 6 weeks
-   Repeat EGD at 12 weeks if negative
-   PET scan at 12 weeks
-   EUS-FNA of suspicious nodes on PET
