## ROBOT-I Clinical Trial

Open McKeown esophagectomy 
vs
Robot-assisted Minimally-invasive Esophagectomy

Anastomotic Leak Rate:

- Open = 20%
- RAMIE = 24%

## Body Composition Analysis from CT scan images

Muscle mass and quality can be measured from staging CT scans and have been shown to accurately predict surgical outcomes

## Methods

-   399 Minimally-invasive esophagectomy
-   Skeletal Muscle Gauge: abdominal wall muscle area × muscle density from CT
-   “Low Muscle”: Bottom quartile SMG
-   Age categorized as \<75 vs 75+
-   Operative mortality at 90 days compared based upon age and skeletal muscle

## Conclusions

CT-derived muscle measurements accurately risk-stratify patients undergoing minimally-invasive esophagectomy:\

Normal Muscle and Age \<75:

-   1.8% mortality (n=281)\

\
Low Muscle and Age 75+:

-   32% mortality (n=28)
