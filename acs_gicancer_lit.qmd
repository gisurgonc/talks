# Triage Guidelines

# Esophageal Cancer

Triage questions:

-   Has EGD been done? Pathology results?
-   Presence of metastatic disease on CT chest/abdomen/pelvis?
-   Upper GI bleeding requiring transfusion?
-   Can patient maintain hydration orally?

## Esophageal Cancer new diagnosis without obstruction or bleeding

Patients who can maintain their hydration orally can be managed as an outpatient and generally do not need transfer to CMC or inpatient stay

### Acute Management

-   Transfusion
-   Correction of clotting abnormalities
-   IV hydration
-   Correction of electrolyte abnormalities

### Inpatient Management

-   Radiation Oncology consultation: Possible need for inpatient radiation
-   CT C/A/P with IV contrast
-   If small tumor $\rightarrow$ Advanced GI Consult for EUS
-   Medical Oncology consult: "Is patient a candidate for palliative chemotherapy?"
-   Central venous port for candidates for chemotherapy
-   Feeding tube
    -   PEG for patients with metastatic disease
    -   Laparoscopic feeding tube for those without metastatic disease
        -   Lap gastrostomy preferred
        -   Lap jejunostomy acceptable

## Rationale

Patients with esophageal cancer with dysphagia are clinically staged as T3 and fit into one of two caregories:

-   Patients with metastatic disease (liver, lung, or extra-regional lymphadenopathy with cervical or para-aortic nodes). Treatment is chemotherapy with radiation for palliation of dysphagia or treatment of symptomatic bone metastasis
-   Patients without metastatic disease are staged Locally Advanced and treated with preoperative chemotherapy $\pm$ radiation followed by surgery. Surgery as primary therapy is not indicated except for cancer perforation.

## Endoscopy

Endoscopy with biopsy is foundational in the evaluation of patients with esophageal obstruction.

The majority will hvae evidence of malignancy on EGD. Negative endoscopic biopsies in the patient with an obstructing esophageal stricture are unusual but not rare.

Options for re-biopsy include use of a neonatal (5mm) endoscope, dilation followed by biopsy, and endoscopic ultrasound with FNA. These options are available at CMC Main and may not be available at regional facilities. [@faigel2257]

## Staging

Patients with esophageal cancer need CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast for initial staging.

### PET

PET scan is needed for complete staging but ordinarily is not always required in the acute setting. PET is required for accurate planning for radiation therapy. Patients who need inpatient PET need to be NPO with water only (no sugar-containing oral intake) and be without intravenous dextrose for 4 hours and have blood sugars controlled.

### Endoscopic ultrasound

EUS has limited utility in the staging of patients with esophageal cancer who present with dysphagia [@mansfield3227] [@findlay1488] [@radlinski5850] [@ripley226] and is not necessary in these patients. EUS is most helpful In general, patients with esophageal cancer who need EUS can have it performed as an outpatient.

# Esophageal Obstruction

Patients with esophageal obstruction from cancer need treatment of electrolyte and fluid abnormalities, nutritional support, and venous access for administration of chemotherapy.

## Endoscopic stents

Endoscopic stents to treat esophageal obstruction are appropriate in patients with documented metastatic disease and those who will never be candidates for surgery.

In patients who are potentially candidates for esophagectomy, stents are generally avoided to prevent complications of surgery through fibrosis of the esohagus proximal to the tumor.

A retrospective study of patients with esophageal cancer and dysphagia [@mine0179522] found that treatment with gastrostomy was associated with longer survival than those treated with a endoscopic stent and had higher albumin levels and less need for re-intervention.

## Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy

For patients with Stage IV disease, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is indicated for nutritional support. A gastrostomy allows for bolus feeding and is more convenient for patients than a jejunostomy, which requires an infusion pump.

For patients with potentially resectable disease, PEG is avoided to prevent injury to the right gastroepiploic artery and the risk of tumor seeding of the gastrostomy tract.

## Laparoscopic Jejunostomy

Jejunostomy is the traditional method of nutritional support for patients with esophageal obstruction. This avoids the risk of injury to the future gastric conduit at the time of esophagectomy.

[Postoperative Care for Jejunostomy](https://gisurgonc.github.io/handbook/03-jejunostomy.html)

## Laparoscopic Gastrostomy

Laparoscopic gastrostomy is a viable alternative to jejunostomy. Gastrostomy tubes are more convenient for the patient as feedings can be done by bolus feedings, while jejunostomy feeding requires a pump over extended periods (12-16 hours).

The laparoscopic approach allows placement of the tube away from the right gastroepiploic artery. Findings the ideal location for the tube involves laparoscopy with low insufflation pressure (4mm Hg), which allows adequate distention of the stomach with an endoscope. A neonatal (5mm) endoscope can be helpful. A site is selected at the midpoint of the stomach on a saggital plane to allow minimal tension on the tube. The tube is placed as far proximally on the stomach as possible yet still at least 3cm from the left costal margin (for patient comfort and to allow minimal tension on the gastrostomy tube).

## Central Venous Port

Central venous port can facilitate the administration of chemotherapy but is not essential in the acute management of patients with esophageal cancer, particularly patients with poor performance status who may not receive chemotherapy once they meet with their treating medical oncologist. Inpatient medical oncology consultation can help sort out which patients are not candidates for chemotherapy.

# Bleeding Esophageal Cancer

Bleeding from esophageal cancer usually occurs in the context of anticoagulation or anti-platelet therapy. Once these are stopped, bleeding usually stops. Because bleeding can lead to an earlier diagnosis, some patients with bleeding may be a candidate for early surgery if they are shown to be T2 N0 M0 on staging. Patient with small bleeding tumors should undergo EUS once stabilized. EUS can be helpful is distinguishing T2 N0 (which are candidates for primary surgery) vs T3 or N1 (which should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy $\pm$ radiation prior to surgery).
