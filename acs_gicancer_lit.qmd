# Esophageal Cancer

## Overview

Patients with esophageal cancer with dysphagia are clinically staged as T3 and fit into one of two caregories:

- Patients with metastatic disease (liver, lung, or extra-regional lymphadenopathy with cervical or para-aortic nodes). Treatment is chemotherapy with radiation for palliation of dysphagia or treatment of symptomatic bone metastasis
- Patients without metastatic disease are staged Locally Advanced and treated with preoperative chemotherapy $\pm$ radiation followed by surgery. Surgery as primary therapy is not indicated except for cancer perforation. 

## Endoscopy

Endoscopy with biopsy is foundational in the evaluation of patients with esophageal obstruction.

The majority will hvae evidence of malignancy on EGD. Negative endoscopic biopsies in the patient with an obstructing esophageal stricture are unusual but not rare.

Options for re-biopsy include use of a neonatal (5mm) endoscope, dilation followed by biopsy, and endoscopic ultrasound with FNA.  These options are available at CMC Main and may not be available at regional facilities. [@faigel2257]

## Staging

Patients with esophageal cancer need CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast for initial staging.

### PET

PET scan is needed for complete staging but ordinarily is not always required in the acute setting. PET is required for accurate planning for radiation therapy. Patients who need inpatient PET need to be NPO with water only (no sugar-containing oral intake) and be without intravenous dextrose for 4 hours and have blood sugars controlled.

### Endoscopic ultrasound

EUS has limited utility in the staging of patients with esophageal cancer who present with dysphagia [@mansfield3227] [@findlay1488] [@radlinski5850] [@ripley226] and is not necessary in these patients. In general, patients with esophageal cancer who need EUS can have it performed as an outpatient. 

# Esophageal Obstruction

Patients with esophageal obstruction from cancer need treatment of electrolyte and fluid abnormalities, nutritional support, and venous access for administration of chemotherapy.

## Endoscopic stents

Endoscopic stents to treat esophageal obstruction are appropriate in patients with documented metastatic disease and those who will never be candidates for surgery.  

In patients who are potentially candidates for esophagectomy, stents are generally avoided to prevent complications of surgery through fibrosis of the esohagus proximal to the tumor.

A retrospective study of patients with esophageal cancer and dysphagia [@mine0179522] found that treatment with gastrostomy was associated with longer survival than those treated with a endoscopic stent and had higher albumin levels and less need for re-intervention. 

## Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy

For patients with Stage IV disease, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is indicated for nutritional support.  A gastrostomy allows for bolus feeding and is more convenient for patients than a jejunostomy, which requires an infusion pump. 

For patients with potentially resectable disease, PEG is avoided to prevent injury to the right gastroepiploic artery and the risk of tumor seeding of the gastrostomy tract.

## Laparoscoic Jejunostomy

Jejunostomy is the traditional method of nutritional support for patients with esophageal obstruction.  This avoids the risk of injury to the future gastric conduit at the time of esophagectomy.

## Laparoscopic Gastrostomy

Laparoscopic gastrostomy is a viable alternative to jejunostomy.  Gastrostomy tubes are more convenient for the patient as feedings can be done by bolus feedings, while jejunostomy feeding requires a pump over extended periods (12-16 hours).

The laparoscopic approach allows placement of the tube away from the right gastroepiploic artery.  Findings the ideal location for the tube involves laparoscopy with low insufflation pressure (4mm Hg), which allows adequate distention of the stomach with an endoscope.  A neonatal (5mm) endoscope can be helpful.  A site is selected at the midpoint of the stomach on a saggital plane to allow minimal tension on the tube.  The tube is placed as far proximally on the stomach as possible yet still at least 3cm from the left costal margin (for patient comfort and to allow minimal tension on the gastrostomy tube).

# Esophageal Cancer - Background

Emergency presentation of esophageal cancer is associated with poor prognosis due to increased incidence of metastatic diseaase [@markar711]

# Esophageal Cancer with bleeding

# Perforated Esophageal Cancer





Perforated esophageal cancer most commonly occurs after endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, or dilation of an esophageal cancer (or benign stricture).  Endoscopic stenting is generally not feasible due to the underlying stricture. Treatment options are conservative management with drainage and IV antibiotics or emergency surgery. [@abu-daff34]


### Cervical esophageal perforation

Contained perforations of the cervical esophagus can be treated with NPO and IV antibiotics. Uncontained perforations need surgical exploration.  In this case, nutritional support with gastrostomy is indicated. 

### Thoracic esophageal perforations

abbas Pittsburgh [@abbas749]

Validation of Pittsburgh scoring system [@schweigert1002]

A series from Birmingham UK of 74 esophageal perforations over 15 years include 13 patients with perforated cancers, of whom 7 were treated with endoscoic stenting [@charalampakis1710]. These 13 patients had a 1-year mortality of 77%

These patients need immediate consultation with thoracic surgery and GI surgical oncology to formulate a treatment plan.

## Diagnosis

CT esophagram with water soluble is the diagnostic study of choice[@suarez-poveda505]

A study from Colorado [@madsen2984] of 65 patients transferred with suspected esophageal perforation found that 24 patients were ultimately found not to have a perforation. Among patients for whom pneumomediastinum was their sole criteria for transfer, only 57% were ultimately found to have a perforation. Among patients with a pleural effusion prior to transfer, 83% were ultimately found to have a perforation. Patients with a lactate greater than 1.6 were 11 times more likely to have  aperforation.

## Conservative management



## Emergent surgery

Emergency esophagectomy is the traditional approach to perforated esophageal cancer given the difficulty in stenting an area of tumor (or stricture).  Short-term goals are fluid resuscitation, IV antibiotics, and drainage of the pleurae (and abdomen).  

Emergent esophagogastrectomy via an abdominal and thoracic approach is the conventional approach in a fit patient.  For frail patients, an transabdominal approach with esophagogastrostomy is less morbid [@gillen3065] although placing the patient at higher risk of postoperative reflux.


# Tracheoesophageal fistula

Tracheoesophageal fistula in the context of esophageal cancer is most commonly due to squamous cell carcinoma. These patients need immediate consultation with thoracic surgery and interventional pulmonology.
